Fortunately, it seems the undead weren't concerned with the living as long they stepped out of the hallway and the adventurers were able to escape with no harm to the scholars.

The scholars have now made another request to the Adventurer Guild. They ask the Guild to remove the undead from the hallway so that they can study whatever is behind that door."
