On their turn, characters have a number of Action Points(AP)(2) to spend on actions(3)."
9014343536645,TUTORIAL2_PAGE2,"To end your turn click on the ""End Turn"" option(5). Once per round you can also delay(4) your current character's turn and put them at the end of the turn order. However, this will give you a 50% penalty on your initative for the next turn order calculation."

9014343536652,TUTORIAL3_PAGE3,But be careful while spending your BP. Having too little BP gives minor debuffs to the adventurer and risks them getting the <i>Shaken</i> status when they reach zero BP. Meanwhile having high BP gives your adventurers minor buffs. Always consider the tradeoff when using BP.
9014343536653,TUTORIAL3_PAGE4,"There are several ways to gain BP. Defeating an enemy, landing a crit or getting encouragement from allies with close relations. Likewise BP can be lost by getting too hurt or having allies die. High bravery adventurers gain BP faster than low bravery adventurers."

"
9014343536660,TUTORIAL5_PAGE3,"The extent of damage increase depends on the relationship between the adventurer (the initiator) and the ally.
