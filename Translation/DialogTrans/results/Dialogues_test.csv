1044977192960,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,再给你来一杯。 
1044977192961,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,*咕噜*，*咕噜*...啊！真是太爽了！ 
1044977192962,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,... 
1044977192963,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"抱歉，弗兰。
我知道我无法永远逃避。 "
1044977192964,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,我还是很难相信你已经死了。当我来到这里时，我心里的一部分以为这只是个把我叫回来的把戏。 
1044977192965,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,我当时准备好要揍你一拳，哈哈哈！ 
1044977192966,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,*咕噜*，*咕噜*... 
1044977192967,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,你是不是在想我为什么不问任何人你是怎么死的？ 
1044977192968,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...我想我不想知道。 
1044977192969,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,你那个女巫妻子一次都没提起过。这就是我需要知道的一切。 
1044977192970,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,我选择相信你在30岁时安详地在梦中离开了。 
1044977192971,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,*咕噜*，*咕噜*... 
1044977192972,DIALOGUESCENE1_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,... 
1044977192973,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...对不起，弗兰妮。 
1044977192974,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,为了离开... 
1044977192975,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,为了十年来一直避开你。 
1044977192976,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...你永远不知道自己有多愚蠢，直到为时已晚。 
1044977192977,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,*咕噜*，*咕噜*... 
1044977192978,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...你恨我吗，弗兰妮?... 
1044977192979,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...你只是因为没有更好的选择才给我写信吗？ 
1044977192980,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>*咕噜*，*咕噜*，*咕噜*...哈啊... 
1044977192981,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...这没关系。 
1044977192982,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,我记得你的梦想...我们的梦想。 
1044977192983,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,一个冒险者公会...一个属于我们这样人的家。 
1044977192984,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,远近闻名，备受尊敬。 
1044977192985,DIALOGUESCENE2_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,...我向你发誓，弗兰妮...我会让它成为现实。 
1044977192986,DIALOGUESCENE3_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,... 
1044977192987,DIALOGUESCENE3_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>你在这里做什么？ 
1044977192988,DIALOGUESCENE3_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,显然，我是来向我丈夫致敬的，你这个迟钝的笨蛋。 
1044977192989,DIALOGUESCENE3_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,啧！真是个糟糕的时机。 
1044977192990,DIALOGUESCENE3_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,等我忙完再回来。 
1044977192991,DIALOGUESCENE3_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,谁知道你什么时候忙完？我不走。 
1044977192992,DIALOGUESCENE3_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,*叹气* 好吧。那就留下吧！我真的不想在这里和你争论。 
1044977192993,DIALOGUESCENE3_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,... 
1044977192994,DIALOGUESCENE3_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...所以你真的不打算离开？ 
1044977192995,DIALOGUESCENE3_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,"又来了？
不，我不打算离开。 "
1044977192996,DIALOGUESCENE3_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,你知道这和你无关，对吧？冒险者公会是我和弗兰妮想出来的。在我们见到你之前。 
1044977192997,DIALOGUESCENE3_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,这和你没有任何关系。 
1044977192998,DIALOGUESCENE4_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash><b>You</b> out of all people are saying that to me?

1044981387264,DIALOGUESCENE4_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,I don't know why he made you his successor.
1044981387265,DIALOGUESCENE4_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,I only know that any <?shakeScreen><b>stranger</b> on the streets would have been a better choice than you!

1044981387268,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,Midnight! I guess it's time to close the doors.
1044981387269,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>Oh! Guild Master!
1044981387270,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Hello Tavi! Are you closing?
1044981387271,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I was hoping I could still get some ale for the night.
1044981387272,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,I can still serve you if you'd like.
1044981387273,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
1044981387274,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,Wait a moment.<?fadeOutNPC>

1044981387277,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Thanks.
1044981387278,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"*Gulp*, *Gulp* Ahhhhh! This one is pretty good."
1044981387279,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE12,"...Hard day, huh?"
1044981387280,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,It was.
1044981387281,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE14,It had to be if you just show up now.
1044981387282,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"Nah, that wasn't the reason. I just don't like to drink with too many people around."
1044981387283,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE16,So you just waited until no one else was around to drink?
1044981387284,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,Pretty much.
1044981387285,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE18,I had the impression you were more sociable than that when you were around the adventurers.
1044981387286,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,I'm their Guild Master. Of course I need them to like me.
1044981387287,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,...Please don't tell them that.
1044981387288,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE21,"<?shakeScreen>Hahaha, are you already getting drunk?"
1044981387289,DIALOGUESCENE5_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,Of course not! It takes far more than that before I even start to become drunk!
1044981387290,DIALOGUESCENE5_TAVI_DIALOGUE23,...
1044981387291,DIALOGUESCENE6_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,Doesn't it feel kinda lonely to drink by yourself?
1044981387292,DIALOGUESCENE6_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,I'm used to it. I drank alone the last ten years.
1044981387293,DIALOGUESCENE6_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,"...That's an awfully long time. 
And before that?"
1044981387294,DIALOGUESCENE6_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...Before that...I used to drink with Franny.
1044981387295,DIALOGUESCENE6_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,You mean the former Guild Master?
1044981387296,DIALOGUESCENE6_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Yeah...
But he's dead now..."
1044981387297,DIALOGUESCENE6_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...
1044981387298,DIALOGUESCENE6_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"...You know what?
Just give me two more bottles of ale and I'll just drink in my room. "
1044981387299,DIALOGUESCENE6_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,There is no reason for me to keep you from going to bed any longer.
1044981387300,DIALOGUESCENE6_TAVI_DIALOGUE10,...
1044981387301,DIALOGUESCENE6_TAVI_DIALOGUE11,<?whiteFlash>I can't let you do that.
1044981387302,DIALOGUESCENE6_TAVI_DIALOGUE12,"This isn't a takeway place, Guild Master! If you want to drink, you have to do it here!"
1044981387303,DIALOGUESCENE6_TAVI_DIALOGUE13,But...I have a counter offer.
1044981387304,DIALOGUESCENE7_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,I'll go and get another cup and we can drink together.
1044981387305,DIALOGUESCENE7_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...You don't have to do this.
1044981387306,DIALOGUESCENE7_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,Why not? Don't tell me you're afraid that you can't keep up with me?
1044981387307,DIALOGUESCENE7_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,I mean you're awfully loose-lipped after just one cup of ale.
1044981387308,DIALOGUESCENE7_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I'll be a lousy companion.
1044981387309,DIALOGUESCENE7_TAVI_DIALOGUE6,"Hey! I'm part of the Guild too! That means just like with your adventurers you need me to like you too!
So you have to try harder than that!"
1044981387310,DIALOGUESCENE7_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,For example you could start by saying that my drinks will also be on your tab.
1044981387311,DIALOGUESCENE7_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"...Fine, you win. I'll try and have a nice time with you.
And just so you know, I don't think <b>you</b> can keep up with me."
1044981387312,DIALOGUESCENE7_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,I've hardly ever seen anybody who could drink me under the table.
1044981387313,DIALOGUESCENE7_TAVI_DIALOGUE10,Then how about we make a bet? The first one to vomit has to pay the drinks of the winner?
1044981387314,DIALOGUESCENE7_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,Deal! This will be easy.
1044981387315,DIALOGUESCENE7_TAVI_DIALOGUE12,"You're underestimating me, Guild Master!"
1044981387316,DIALOGUESCENE8_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,...Really? So that's what happened in the end? That seems farfetched.
1044981387317,DIALOGUESCENE8_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Hand on heart. It's exactly as I told you.
1044981387318,DIALOGUESCENE9_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,"Hahaha! And then my husband had to walk all the way back to the dormitories without his pants! And I was like ""Honey, I think at this point you can just walk straight. You're doing a poor job of hiding your manhood."""
1044981387319,DIALOGUESCENE9_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>Pfft! Hahaha *cough*, *cough*. Damn, I shouldn't have taken a sip in that moment."
1044981387320,DIALOGUESCENE10_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"...And I told Franny: ""Franny! I'm 99% sure, he has no sick grandmother and we're just walking into an ambush!""."
1044981387321,DIALOGUESCENE10_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,And then what happened?
1044981387322,DIALOGUESCENE10_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,We walked into an ambush!
1044981387323,DIALOGUESCENE11_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,You...you shtopped drinking. That's not...fair.
1044981387324,DIALOGUESCENE11_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,Dat'ss cause you're behind a cup. Ughh....You need to drink fisht before I continue.
1044981387325,DIALOGUESCENE12_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Ugh...my head...

1044981387327,DIALOGUESCENE12_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,...uggghhh...doesn't feel like it.

1044981387329,DIALOGUESCENE12_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,Why are the both of you lying on the ground?

1044981387334,DIALOGUESCENE13_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,Are you sure about this?
1044981387335,DIALOGUESCENE13_NORA_DIALOGUE3,Yes...I've been watching him and I don't think he had a proper meal for days now.
1044981387336,DIALOGUESCENE13_NORA_DIALOGUE4,He's already starting to look pale. If we don't do something he'll collapse.
1044981387337,DIALOGUESCENE13_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,And that's why you want <b>me</b> to deliver him the food <b>you</b> made for him...
1044981387338,DIALOGUESCENE13_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,...and tell him it's from <b>me</b>?
1044981387339,DIALOGUESCENE13_NORA_DIALOGUE7,"Y-yes. If it's from me, he might not eat it..."
1044981387340,DIALOGUESCENE13_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,Why me?
1044981387341,DIALOGUESCENE13_NORA_DIALOGUE9,"Y-You're friends, right? I thought he might listen to you."
1044981387342,DIALOGUESCENE13_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,"<?shakeScreenWeak> Not the ""I personally made a homemade lunch for you and it's not weird""-kind of friends."

1044981387348,DIALOGUESCENE14_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,Is it that obvious?
1044981387349,DIALOGUESCENE14_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,I have to confess I've been preoccupied lately and haven't had much time to rest.
1044981387350,DIALOGUESCENE14_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,What about food? 
1044981387351,DIALOGUESCENE14_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,I'd be lying if I said I had much.
1044981387352,DIALOGUESCENE14_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,I...actually brought food for you.

1044985581582,DIALOGUESCENE19_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,...What was that? What were you going to say before that?
1044985581583,DIALOGUESCENE19_EMILY_DIALOGUE23,"...I have no idea what you mean, mom - I mean - Guild Master!"
1044985581584,DIALOGUESCENE19_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,It sounded like you actually like to eat...
1044985581585,DIALOGUESCENE19_EMILY_DIALOGUE25,<?shakeScreen>Oh right! I still needed to do some errands!<?fadeOutNPC>
1044985581586,DIALOGUESCENE19_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE26,"<?shakeScreen> Hey!
<?shakeScreen> We're not done talking, young lady! Come right back here!"
1044985581587,DIALOGUESCENE20_SOLDIER_DIALOGUE1,Now we have to take the path to the west.
1044985581588,DIALOGUESCENE20_SOLDIER_DIALOGUE2,Be careful. There is another patrol ahead.
1044985581589,DIALOGUESCENE21_SOLDIER_DIALOGUE1,We've almost reached the hideout. We only have to follow the path in the north.

1044985581591,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,...
1044985581592,DIALOGUESCENE22_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...What are you doing?
1044985581593,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>G-Guild Master!
1044985581594,DIALOGUESCENE22_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE5,Hmm? Is someone there?
1044985581595,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,"<?shakeScreen>Fast, Guild Master! We have to hide!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1044985581596,DIALOGUESCENE22_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,W-wait!<?shakeScreen>
1044985581597,DIALOGUESCENE22_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE8,...<?whiteFlash>I guess it was just the wind.
1044985581598,DIALOGUESCENE22_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Will you tell me now what you're doing? Because it seemed like you were spying on Me'can.
1044985581599,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,<?shakeScreen>Of course I was spying on the merchant! Look at him!
1044985581600,DIALOGUESCENE22_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE11,*Continues whistling an innocent tune*
1044985581601,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreen>I've tried for so long to find any info about that man but nothing! I've found nothing!
1044985581602,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreen>Even worse than nothing! I have the suspicion that he is actually messing with my investigations.
1044985581603,DIALOGUESCENE22_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,How so?
1044985581604,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE15,"...
For a while I thought he was my grandmother..."
1044985581605,DIALOGUESCENE22_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,...You have to give me the details to that.
1044985581606,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE17,<?shakeScreen>N-Nevermind that!
1044985581607,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE18,<?shakeScreen>How could you let such a suspicious person freely roam around here?
1044985581608,DIALOGUESCENE22_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,"""Said the mysterious hooded woman, incapable of seeing the irony in her statement."""
1044985581609,DIALOGUESCENE22_ROGUE_DIALOGUE20,<?shakeScreen>T-This is different!

1044985581613,DIALOGUESCENE23_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE3,...Can you hear me?
1044985581614,DIALOGUESCENE23_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE4,Good. Good. I like to report that they still don't suspect a thing.
1044985581615,DIALOGUESCENE23_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE5,"Yes, everything is ready for tonight's operation. Everything is in place."
1044985581616,DIALOGUESCENE23_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>I-I knew it! He's trying something!
1044985581617,DIALOGUESCENE23_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>We have to regroup and discuss how to respond to this threat!

1044985581623,DIALOGUESCENE24_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...You knew we were here, didn't you?"
1044985581624,DIALOGUESCENE24_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE4,Very much so.
1044985581625,DIALOGUESCENE24_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,And the scroll you used earlier?
1044985581626,DIALOGUESCENE24_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE6,Just a magical scroll that creates a short bright light.
1044985581627,DIALOGUESCENE24_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"So, you were just messing around?"
1044985581628,DIALOGUESCENE24_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE8,Guilty as charged.
1044985581629,DIALOGUESCENE24_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"...You know that one day she is going to snap, kidnap you, and interrogate you, right?"
1044985581630,DIALOGUESCENE24_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE10,"And the first two words that'll come out of my mouth will be: ""Worth it!"""
1044985581631,DIALOGUESCENE25_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,*sighs* Why do we keep having this conversation?
1044985581632,DIALOGUESCENE25_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,I'd be perfectly fine if we drop it.
1044985581633,DIALOGUESCENE25_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>The hell we will! The adventurers keep complaining about you!
1044985581634,DIALOGUESCENE25_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,I mean did you really have to make them run laps around the training ground for each mistake they made?
1044985581635,DIALOGUESCENE25_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,I mean in your eye everyone makes ten mistakes.
1044985581636,DIALOGUESCENE25_ASTRID_DIALOGUE6,I'm just making sure that they'll make it as adventurers. You know as well as I do that even a single mistake could cost them their lifes.
1044985581637,DIALOGUESCENE25_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,But they'll hate you!
1044985581638,DIALOGUESCENE25_ASTRID_DIALOGUE8,So what? I don't care what they think about me!
1044985581639,DIALOGUESCENE26_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,...Do you really want to make everyone your enemy?
1044985581640,DIALOGUESCENE26_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"I'm worried about you, Astrid."
1044985581641,DIALOGUESCENE26_ASTRID_DIALOGUE3,<?whiteFlash>Why do you care?
1044985581642,DIALOGUESCENE26_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"I mean, we've known each other for years now. We're friends, so of course I'm worried."
1044985581643,DIALOGUESCENE26_ASTRID_DIALOGUE5,...We're not friends. We're colleagues at best.
1044985581644,DIALOGUESCENE26_ASTRID_DIALOGUE6,And even that doesn't mean much.
1044985581645,DIALOGUESCENE26_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,...
1044985581646,DIALOGUESCENE26_ASTRID_DIALOGUE8,...I'm tired of this conversation. Come to me if you really have something important to talk about.<?fadeOutNPC>
1044985581647,DIALOGUESCENE26_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,...*sighs*
1044985581648,DIALOGUESCENE27_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,"Finally, another day of horrible training is over."
1044985581649,DIALOGUESCENE27_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE2,You can say that again. 
1044985581650,DIALOGUESCENE27_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,Did it seem to you like that tyrannical woman was in an even worse mood than usual today?
1044985581651,DIALOGUESCENE27_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE4,How I am supposed to tell? Her default emotion is angry.
1044985581652,DIALOGUESCENE27_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,I'm really tired of that woman letting out her frustration in the training sessions.
1044985581653,DIALOGUESCENE27_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE6,Me too. But you know what?
1044985581654,DIALOGUESCENE27_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE7,"I still prefer her training sessions over those with that cripple ""Falken""."
1044985581655,DIALOGUESCENE27_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE8,Feels wrong to learn something from someone who would just fall in a real battle.
1044985581656,DIALOGUESCENE27_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE9,"Yeah, what's up with that? I'm pretty sure I could take him on in a fight. And I'm supposed to learn from somebody like that?"
1044985581657,DIALOGUESCENE27_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE10,"Anybody could take him on! Hey, how about next time when we see the cripple, we embarass him by...<?shakeScreen><?fadeOutNPC>"
1044985581658,DIALOGUESCENE27_ASTRID_DIALOGUE11,<?whiteFlash>...
1044985581659,DIALOGUESCENE27_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE12,A-Astrid!
1044985581660,DIALOGUESCENE27_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreen>What the hell was that punch for?!
1044985581661,DIALOGUESCENE27_ASTRID_DIALOGUE14,"...How about before talking about taking on a cripple you try fighting a one-eyed, huh?"
1044985581662,DIALOGUESCENE28_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,Here are some more bandages.
1044985581663,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,Thanks Tavi.
1044985581664,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,...
1044985581665,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>Careful! It stings!
1044985581666,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,Serves you right! Getting into a fight with the adventurers. What were you thinking?
1044985581667,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE6,None of your business what I was thinking.
1044985581668,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,...
1044985581669,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,...
1044985581670,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE9,...What are you smiling about?
1044985581671,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,...I've just remembered the last time I bandaged you like this.
1044985581672,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,"At that time you were still an adventurer and it was just coincidence that no one else was there to treat your wounds. 
So in the end, I decided to do it myself."
1044985581673,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,I first thought that you just started a fight because that's how you were but I was surprised when people told me you stood up for a fellow adventurer who was being harassed.
1044985581674,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE13,Was it something like that this time also?
1044985581675,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE14,You have no reason to believe that.
1044985581676,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15,I think I know you long enough now to know that. You might not think that we are friends but I still think I know you well enough to know that you wouldn't start a fight without a reason.
1044985581677,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE16,...You don't know that...You will never know that.
1044985581678,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE17,"If you believe in people, you'll just be disappointed."
1044985581679,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE18,"...You have to let it go, Astrid. They're gone. He is gone..."
1044985581680,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE19,...
1044985581681,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE20,...About earlier...when I said we're just colleagues.
1044985581682,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE21,...Maybe...we're more than that...
1044985581683,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE22,...So we're friends?
1044985581684,DIALOGUESCENE28_ASTRID_DIALOGUE23,...Good aquaintances...
1044985581685,DIALOGUESCENE28_FALKEN_DIALOGUE24,"You're really not making it easy, are you?"
1044985581686,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Hey Barret! I need you repair something for....
1044985581687,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"<?whiteFlash>?!
Oh, Majika! You're also here?"
1044985581688,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,"Indeed, Guild Master. It's tea time after all."
1044985581689,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"(Now, that I'm looking. The two of them are really currently drinking tea together.)"
1044985581690,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,Etiquette demands that I ask you if you'd also like a cup of tea.
1044989775872,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Well, uh...I..."
1044989775873,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,I'll just interpret that as an affirmative to save us both time.
1044989775874,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,"Barret, would you kindly?"
1044989775875,DIALOGUESCENE29_BARRET_DIALOGUE9,...<?fadeOutNPC>
1044989775876,DIALOGUESCENE29_BARRET_DIALOGUE10,...Here Guild Master.
1044989775877,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,...Uh...thanks.
1044989775878,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...
1044989775879,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,<?whiteFlash>It's good! Where did you get the tea leaves?
1044989775880,DIALOGUESCENE29_BARRET_DIALOGUE14,Grew it in my garden.
1044989775881,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,...You...have a garden?
1044989775882,DIALOGUESCENE29_BARRET_DIALOGUE16,Yes.
1044989775883,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,I see...(I can not read this guy.)
1044989775884,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"I have to say, I'm quite surprised to see you two spend time together. I didn't really think you had anything in common."
1044989775885,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE19,"Why not? Barret here makes excellent tea and is also an excellent conversation partner. Unlike most people, he does not extensively talk about trivial matters that is of no concern."
1044989775886,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,(Do you actually converse at all?)
1044989775887,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,Are you two...perhaps an item?
1044989775888,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE22,It is disconcerting to witness the propensity of younger generations to assert unsupported theories without a foundation in empirical evidence.
1044989775889,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,Uh...what?
1044989775890,DIALOGUESCENE29_BARRET_DIALOGUE24,We're not an item.
1044989775891,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE25,(Couldn't she just have said that?)
1044989775892,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE26,And it's also worth noting that that we have both already married and have families of our own.
1044989775893,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,"I see...<?shakeScreen>Wait, what!? You are?"
1044989775894,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE28,Yes. I have a husband and a son. They're both living in Cragmond right now.
1044989775895,DIALOGUESCENE29_BARRET_DIALOGUE29,Wife and daughter. Wife died years ago.
1044989775896,DIALOGUESCENE29_BARRET_DIALOGUE30,Daughter lives with son-in-law and granddaughter in a village not too far from here.
1044989775897,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE31,...I..uh see.
1044989775898,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE32,"Considering our advanced age, our familial composition should not come as a surprise to you, Guild Master."
1044989775899,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE33,I...guess not. I just never thought about it.
1044989775900,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE34,"Although, I have to say, that I would never have imagined that you of all people settled down."
1044989775901,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE35,"Believe me Guild Master, when I say that I did not plan on it, when I first met my husband."
1044989775902,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE36,I rather disliked his advances on me but even mountains can slowly get whittled down by water.
1044989775903,DIALOGUESCENE29_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE37,I feel like I have so many questions.
1044989775904,DIALOGUESCENE29_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE38,*sighs* This is why Barret is the only one here I can have a decent conversation with.

1044993970211,DIALOGUESCENE38_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,I can see the dragon! He's just a bit further up!
1044993970212,DIALOGUESCENE38_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,Now go and slay it!
1044993970213,DIALOGUESCENE38_VINCENT _DIALOGUE3,Me? I will be staying here and give you support.
1044993970214,DIALOGUESCENE38_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,Moral support that is.
1044993970215,DIALOGUESCENE38_VINCENT _DIALOGUE5,Now go and make it epic!
1044993970216,DIALOGUESCENE39_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1044993970217,DIALOGUESCENE39_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,<?screenShake>Guild Master! Have you seen Zoldak anywhere?
1044993970218,DIALOGUESCENE39_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Eh... No?
1044993970219,DIALOGUESCENE39_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"By the gods! Where is that man? I've looked everywhere and can't find a trace of him!
I'm worried if he's alone by himself."
1044993970220,DIALOGUESCENE39_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,Zoldak? I think I saw him leaving the Guild this morning. He mentioned going on patrol against evil or something like that.
1044993970221,DIALOGUESCENE39_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>What!? Why didn't you stop him?
1044993970222,DIALOGUESCENE39_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>I-I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
1044993970223,DIALOGUESCENE39_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"He's not a child, Eden. He seems to still be fit for his age, and besides, the area around here is pretty safe."
1044993970224,DIALOGUESCENE39_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. He'll probably be back in no time without any issues.
1044993970225,DIALOGUESCENE40_NORA_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash><?shakeScreen>M-Mr. Eden! Some travelers just carried Zoldak back to the Guild! He's injured!
1044993970226,DIALOGUESCENE40_NORA_DIALOGUE2,"T-They say he fought a bear bare-handed!
"
1044993970227,DIALOGUESCENE40_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,...
1044993970228,DIALOGUESCENE40_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"...Now that I'm thinking about it, I was never much of a gambler."
1044993970229,DIALOGUESCENE41_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,"Great work, boy! I'm back on my feet, ready to fight evil once more!"
1044993970230,DIALOGUESCENE41_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>You will not! What the hell were you thinking? Didn't I tell you to stop doing these 'patrols'?
You nearly died today!"
1044993970231,DIALOGUESCENE41_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE3,"B-But it was for a just cause! I saw some travelers being chased by a bear, and I had to intervene!"
1044993970232,DIALOGUESCENE41_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>By fighting it bare-handed?
1044993970233,DIALOGUESCENE41_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE5,"W-well, it didn't seem necessary to kill it. So, I thought I could maybe simply chase it away through intimidation."
1044993970234,DIALOGUESCENE41_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"I guess that didn't really work out, did it?"
1044993970235,DIALOGUESCENE41_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE7,"No, it did not. In fact, I could swear it was laughing at me. "
1044993970236,DIALOGUESCENE41_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE8,"In the end, I did manage to chase it away, but not before sustaining serious injuries."
1044993970237,DIALOGUESCENE41_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"I have to admit, that's kinda impressive."
1044993970238,DIALOGUESCENE41_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,"Please don't encourage him, Guild Master!"
1044993970239,DIALOGUESCENE42_TRAVELLER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>...Uh... Excuse me?
1044993970240,DIALOGUESCENE42_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,And you are?
1044993970241,DIALOGUESCENE42_TRAVELLER_DIALOGUE3,W-we're the travelers who were chased by the bear.
1044993970242,DIALOGUESCENE42_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,You were the ones who carried Zoldak back! I'm sorry! I forgot to thank you for that.
1044993970243,DIALOGUESCENE42_TRAVELLER_DIALOGUE5,"N-no, no, no! We're the ones who are grateful! If it weren't for your friend here, we might have ended up in the belly of the beast."
1044993970244,DIALOGUESCENE42_TRAVELLER_DIALOGUE6,"For that, you have our gratitude, sir Paladin."
1044993970245,DIALOGUESCENE42_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>There is no need! It is my duty to help anyone in need.
1044993970246,DIALOGUESCENE42_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,"...*Sighs*...
I'll drop the issue for now, Zoldak. I just want you to be more careful."
1044993970247,DIALOGUESCENE42_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,"Helping is all well and good, but you also need to think about yourself more.
Promise me that you won't put yourself in danger like that anymore."
1044993970248,DIALOGUESCENE42_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE10,...I...<?whiteFlash>cannot promise that.<?fadeOutNPC>
1044993970249,DIALOGUESCENE42_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,"<?shakeScreen>W-What?! Come back here, Zoldak!<?fadeOutNPC>
What do you mean by that?"
1044993970250,DIALOGUESCENE42_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...(It's like he's obsessed with helping people.)
1044993970251,DIALOGUESCENE43_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,Now watch me do it.
1044993970252,DIALOGUESCENE43_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"<?grayFlash>(Luana demonstrated an impressive advanced sword technique combined with a fire spell. After the attack hit the unfortunate target, a wooden dummy, there was nothing left but burned pieces.)"
1044993970253,DIALOGUESCENE44_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>T-That was AWESOME!!!
1044993970254,DIALOGUESCENE44_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>Miss Luana! Can you watch me perform that technique from yesterday and tell me if it's good?
1044993970255,DIALOGUESCENE44_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>No! Watch me cast that Ice spell I've learned just for you!
1044993970256,DIALOGUESCENE44_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...She certainly seems popular with the adventurers.
1044993970257,DIALOGUESCENE44_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,"That's because she's a good teacher. The way she teaches is easy to understand, and she pays good attention to where the adventurers make mistakes."
1044993970258,DIALOGUESCENE44_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,"Her own skills with magic and the blade also make them respect her a lot, and yet, despite all of that, she doesn't act superior with anybody.
It's only natural for them to cling to her like moths to a flame."
1044993970259,DIALOGUESCENE44_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,I see...
1044993970260,DIALOGUESCENE44_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?whiteFlash>You don't seem happy about it.
1044993970261,DIALOGUESCENE44_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,"<?shakeScreen>W-what?! W-why would you think that?
O-of course, I'm happy that my friend is so popular and gets so much attention!"
1044993970262,DIALOGUESCENE44_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,<?shakeScreen>Am I worried that she might find other friends and lose interest in me? Of course not!
1044993970263,DIALOGUESCENE45_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1044993970264,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,"...Okay, maybe I'm a little worried."
1044993970265,DIALOGUESCENE45_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Never thought you'd be the possessive type.
1044993970266,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,"...She's just that special. For a long time, I had no one else I could call a friend."
1044993970267,DIALOGUESCENE45_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"No offense, but you two look like you're from two completely different worlds.
How did you meet? "
1044993970268,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,"...I...
..."
1044993970269,DIALOGUESCENE45_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,You don't have to say it if you don't want to.
1044993970270,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,...No. I think I need to tell you this... Although... I'm afraid of how you might react...
1044993970271,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,"It was a long time ago, when I was more of a kid than an adult. In a time where I was still... "
1044993970272,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,..*breathes out* ...<?whiteFlash>an assassin...
1044993970273,DIALOGUESCENE45_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,...
1044993970274,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE12,...You don't seem surprised.
1044993970275,DIALOGUESCENE45_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"...Considering your skills, I can't deny that that possibility might have already crossed my mind."
1044993970276,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE14,...Are you disappointed in me?
1044993970277,DIALOGUESCENE45_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"I'd be lying if I said that I didn't hope my hunch was wrong but... that part of your life is behind you, isn't it?
Then I'll just leave it at that."
1044993970278,DIALOGUESCENE45_ROGUE_DIALOGUE16,...
1044993970279,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"It happened during one of my assignments. I was still young, and despite my talents, I made a mistake that nearly cost me my life."
1044993970280,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,"It was Luana who found me collapsed on the streets and took me into her home and tended to my wounds. 
If it weren't for her, I might not even be alive anymore."
1044993970281,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,"It took me months to recover, and in that time, I tried to get closer to her. Not because I was actually grateful, but because I thought an amicable relationship would make my life easier, trying to stay low at their home while recovering."
1044993970282,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,"..However, I actually ended up caring for her."
1044993970283,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,"She was such a talented girl at a young age, and that's why she was so all alone. Jealousy and envy isolated her from those around her.
Maybe that's why she clung to me so easily when I showed a little affection."
1044993970284,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,"...And maybe that was the same for me.
Just like her, I never had anyone close. We were just two lonely people who found each other."
1044993970285,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,"Even after I recovered and left, I would occasionally secretly return to her, just to spend some time with her. 
I, of course, never told her really who I was or what I did,..."
1044993970286,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,...but I wonder if it was out of secrecy or out of fear of what she might think of me.
1044998164480,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,"However, it all came out in the open with my last target. We were on opposing sides. The Crownguard started to become aware of our existence and tried to protect the target I was supposed to kill."
1044998164481,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,"I actually managed to get to my target but...when I saw Luana on the opposing side,I...just couldn't do it."
1044998164482,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE11,Not in front of her.
1044998164483,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE12,"I thought that that would be the end of it. I would be apprehended, and my relationship with Luana would come to an end."
1044998164484,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE13,"However,...instead she let me go. And that decision cost her everything. Her position, her titles, her fame...everything she has ever worked for."
1044998164485,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE14,"Soon after I left ""them"" and never saw Luana again. I was too ashamed to face her and just continued to look out for her from afar."
1044998164486,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE15,"Well, until, you know...""they"" found out about her."
1044998164487,DIALOGUESCENE46_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,I can see now why she's important to you.
1044998164488,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE17,"...You understand, right Guild Master? She has every reason to resent me for what has happened... and the only reason we were friends was that she had no one else. "
1044998164489,DIALOGUESCENE46_ROGUE_DIALOGUE18,...Maybe I'm worried because I know that I don't deserve her.
1044998164490,DIALOGUESCENE46_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,...
1044998164491,DIALOGUESCENE47_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>What are you two talking about?
1044998164492,DIALOGUESCENE47_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>L-Luana! I... eh... we...
1044998164493,DIALOGUESCENE47_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,We just talked about how much Rogue loves you.
1044998164494,DIALOGUESCENE47_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>G-Guild Master!
1044998164495,DIALOGUESCENE47_LUANA_DIALOGUE5,I know. And I love her too!
1044998164496,DIALOGUESCENE47_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,Ungh....
1044998164497,DIALOGUESCENE47_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"(I think you have nothing to worry about, Rogue.)"
1044998164498,DIALOGUESCENE48_BAI_DIALOGUE1,...
1044998164499,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>Hm? Why is everyone gathered around like this?
1044998164500,DIALOGUESCENE49_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,...
1044998164501,DIALOGUESCENE49_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,...
1044998164502,DIALOGUESCENE49_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,...
1044998164503,DIALOGUESCENE49_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"...Bai...
We need to talk about your drinking."
1044998164504,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE6,That reminds me that I haven't had a drink for the day yet.
1044998164505,DIALOGUESCENE49_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...The day has just barely begun...
1044998164506,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE8,And so?
1044998164507,DIALOGUESCENE49_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"...*sighs* Bai; we've actually gathered here because we think that your drinking is becoming... 
...a problem."
1044998164508,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE10,A problem? How so?
1044998164509,DIALOGUESCENE49_TAVI_DIALOGUE11,"You keep passing out in the tavern, and I constantly have to let you sleep here on the floor because no one can wake you up."
1044998164510,DIALOGUESCENE49_TAVI_DIALOGUE12,And anyone who tries to get too close to you to carry you to a bed gets a punch in the face.
1044998164511,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE13,Did I...?
1044998164512,DIALOGUESCENE49_TAVI_DIALOGUE14,"<?shakeScreen>Yes, Bai! It was my face!"
1044998164513,DIALOGUESCENE49_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15,"Half the time you come to the training ground, you're drunk! And then you just start running around, beating up adventurers and calling it training."
1044998164514,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE16,"Hehehe, that's funny. I bet they get better at running away, though."
1044998164515,DIALOGUESCENE49_FALKEN_DIALOGUE17,"Well...they do,<?shakeScreen> but that's not the point!"
1044998164516,DIALOGUESCENE49_EDEN_DIALOGUE18,"We're worried about your health, Bai. Drinking so much booze can't be good for your liver.
We all just want you to live a little bit healthier and longer."
1044998164517,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE19,...Why are you really here?
1044998164518,DIALOGUESCENE49_EDEN_DIALOGUE20,"...Well...I...
...It would also be great if you'd stop sexually harassing me when you're drunk..."
1044998164519,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE21,Ah! Right! I guess I did that!
1044998164520,DIALOGUESCENE49_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,"As you can see, there are many, many, many, many reasons why we would like you to drink a little bit less."
1044998164521,DIALOGUESCENE49_BAI_DIALOGUE23,Have I done anything to you too?
1044998164522,DIALOGUESCENE49_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,I'm your biggest victim because I'm the one who has to deal with all this headache.
1044998164523,DIALOGUESCENE50_BAI_DIALOGUE1,Wow... I didn't realize how much of a pain in the ass I was.
1044998164524,DIALOGUESCENE50_BAI_DIALOGUE2,"It's just that the booze here is so good, and back at my village, it became harder and harder to find a drink."
1044998164525,DIALOGUESCENE50_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(Something tells me that they just started to hide all the alcohol away from Bai.)
1044998164526,DIALOGUESCENE50_BAI_DIALOGUE4,"But I hear ya. Starting tomorrow, I'll stop drinking as much as I do now."
1044998164527,DIALOGUESCENE50_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Grea...<?whiteFlash>Wait! Tomorrow?
1044998164528,DIALOGUESCENE50_BAI_DIALOGUE6,Can't just let it end like this. Today I want to get completely hammered one last time! 
1044998164529,DIALOGUESCENE50_BAI_DIALOGUE7,"Why don't you all join me? Just one more day of fun, and I promise I'll start behaving."
1044998164530,DIALOGUESCENE50_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"Well, if you promise to drink less..."
1044998164531,DIALOGUESCENE50_TAVI_DIALOGUE9,"This feels like a bad idea, Guild Master..."
1044998164532,DIALOGUESCENE50_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,I guess it's just fair to meet her halfway.
1044998164533,DIALOGUESCENE50_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,"I haven't touched a drop of alcohol in a long time, but if this is what it takes..."
1044998164534,DIALOGUESCENE50_BAI_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreen>Great! Then let's have fun for the rest of the day!
1044998164535,DIALOGUESCENE51_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1044998164536,DIALOGUESCENE51_BAI_DIALOGUE2,Bwahahahaha...<?whiteFlash>huh?
1044998164537,DIALOGUESCENE51_BAI_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>What happened to everyone? You're just lying on the floor like you're all dead. Bwahahaha!
1044998164538,DIALOGUESCENE51_BAI_DIALOGUE4,...
1044998164539,DIALOGUESCENE51_BAI_DIALOGUE5,"<?whiteFlash>Oh, shit. Are you?"
1044998164540,DIALOGUESCENE51_BAI_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>Oh! Nope! There's the vomit! Hahahahaha!
1044998164541,DIALOGUESCENE52_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"Your eyes gleam brighter than any diamond in existence, captivating and enchanting. Your hair flows like silk, gently embracing your tender shoulders."
1044998164542,DIALOGUESCENE52_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE2,Hah....
1044998164543,DIALOGUESCENE52_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,There he goes again.
1044998164544,DIALOGUESCENE52_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Does he do that often?
1044998164545,DIALOGUESCENE52_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,"Every time one of the girls approaches him.
He just showers them with praises and compliments, and they just melt like butter."
1044998164546,DIALOGUESCENE52_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,As expected of a bard.
1044998164547,DIALOGUESCENE52_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,You probably should put a stop to his indiscriminate flirting. There is already some friction between some of the female adventurers. This could end ugly if left unchecked.
1044998164548,DIALOGUESCENE52_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"*Sighs* I'd rather not have that happening.
I'll talk to him."
1044998164549,DIALOGUESCENE53_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Hey, Vincent."
1044998164550,DIALOGUESCENE53_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,"<?whiteFlash>Oh, Guild Master! How wonderful to see you!
How can I be of service?"
1044998164551,DIALOGUESCENE53_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I need to talk to you privately.
1044998164552,DIALOGUESCENE53_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,"Is that so? Well, then excuse me, my lady, but it seems my presence is required elsewhere.
But I promise I'll return to you soon."
1044998164553,DIALOGUESCENE53_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,Don't make me wait too long!
1044998164554,DIALOGUESCENE53_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(It seems like she's completely fallen for him.)
1044998164555,DIALOGUESCENE53_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Alright, Vincent, you need to...."
1044998164556,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>Oh, thank the gods, you came, Guild Master! I wasn't sure what to do in that moment!"
1044998164557,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Huh?
1044998164558,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE3,I-I think she likes me.
1044998164559,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Well, duh..."
1044998164560,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>B-but I don't think she's the one!
1044998164561,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,The one?
1044998164562,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>You know! The one woman I'll spend the rest of my life with!
The only woman I should ever date!"
1044998164563,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...
1044998164564,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE9,"How can I turn her down gently? I don't have much experience with women, so I'm not sure what to say."
1044998164565,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...You're kidding.
1044998164566,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE11,Of course not! I'm always serious in regards to women!
1044998164567,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreen>Then why do you keep flirting with every woman you meet?
1044998164568,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE13,F-Flirting?! I'm just being nice!
1044998164569,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE14,My mother always taught me to always compliment women and treat them special!
1044998164570,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"...So you were just being an idiot...
I really thought you were a womanizer."
1044998164571,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE16,Why would you think that? That's awful!
1044998164572,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"I mean, you're a bard after all."
1044998164573,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE18,<?shakeScreen>What does that have to do with anything?
1044998164574,DIALOGUESCENE54_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,"I mean, you know... the whole 'the bard seduces everything' shtick. The joke with the bard and the dragon..."
1044998164575,DIALOGUESCENE54_VINCENT _DIALOGUE20,"<?shakeScreen>That's such a stereotype, and I take offense to that! The joke with the bard and the dragon doesn't even make sense!"
1044998164576,DIALOGUESCENE55_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"Anyway, what am I supposed to do about my current predicament?"
1044998164577,DIALOGUESCENE55_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"First, you need to change the way you talk to women."
1044998164578,DIALOGUESCENE55_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"If you want to have a friendly conversation, simply mention something like the weather being nice, rather than telling them that their tears could heal leprosy."
1044998164579,DIALOGUESCENE55_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Second, just be honest with the girl and tell her that you don't want to get into a relationship with her. She'll understand, and it's better than just beating around the bush and leading her on."
1044998164580,DIALOGUESCENE55_VINCENT _DIALOGUE5,"I don't like the thought of making her sad, but I guess you're right."
1044998164581,DIALOGUESCENE55_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Of course I am. Now go back and do the right thing.
1044998164582,DIALOGUESCENE55_VINCENT _DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>I will, Guild Master!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1044998164583,DIALOGUESCENE55_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,(Who would have thought? I guess appearances can be deceiving. I guess it just goes to show...)
1044998164584,DIALOGUESCENE55_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>(...aaaand she kicked him between his legs.)
1044998164585,DIALOGUESCENE56_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,It's kinda scary to hear those stories about bandits. I never knew they could be this brutal.
1044998164586,DIALOGUESCENE56_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,They usually aren't.
1044998164587,DIALOGUESCENE56_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...Well, they can be pretty brutal but the stories we've been hearing lately go even beyond that."
1044998164588,DIALOGUESCENE56_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,I guess I got lucky then when I got robbed that one time.
1044998164589,DIALOGUESCENE56_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1044998164590,DIALOGUESCENE56_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>You...got robbed?!
1044998164591,DIALOGUESCENE56_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,Just once...
1044998164592,DIALOGUESCENE56_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"<?shakeScreen>Why are you saying that, like you just accidentally put on the wrong socks?"
1044998164593,DIALOGUESCENE56_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,What happened? Did they do anything to you?
1044998164594,DIALOGUESCENE56_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,"No, it wasn't that bad. They took a bit of my money and travelling supplies but left me enough to continue travelling."
1044998164595,DIALOGUESCENE56_EMILY_DIALOGUE11,"When I told them that I was looking for the Flower of Eternity, they even wished me luck."
1044998164596,DIALOGUESCENE56_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...
1044998164597,DIALOGUESCENE56_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,You got beyond lucky...
1044998164598,DIALOGUESCENE57_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,A bandit King?  That sounds kinda terrifying. I don't want to know what they're like.
1044998164599,DIALOGUESCENE57_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Yeah, with him around it  seems like there will be more bandits involved in the future Quests. Do you have anything that could help the adventurers?"
1044998164600,DIALOGUESCENE57_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,I could make them some potions of speed to help them run faster.
1044998164601,DIALOGUESCENE57_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...I was hoping something more combat-oriented.
1044998164602,DIALOGUESCENE57_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,"Ah! Right, sorry!"
1044998164603,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen> Guild Masssshter!! Where you been?*hic* 
Everyone has been looking for you!"
1044998164604,DIALOGUESCENE59_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...Are you drunk? At this hour?
1044998164605,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"<?shakeScreen>Ahahaha, of course, I'm drunk! We're celebrating, after all! Didn't we tell ya?"
1044998164606,DIALOGUESCENE59_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"No, you did...I didn't think you meant literally right after."
1044998164607,DIALOGUESCENE59_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,"Really, Falken? You're drunk? At this hour?"
1044998164608,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>Fiola! We missed ya too! Why aren't you celebrating with us in the tavern?
1044998164609,DIALOGUESCENE59_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,*Sighs* I'd rather get some work done. 
1044998164610,DIALOGUESCENE59_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"I hate to agree with Fiola but same here, Falken. I'm not much of a party person anyway."
1044998164611,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,"<?shakeScreen> Whaaaaat?! You two can't be serious! *Hic!*
Our adventurers just completed a major achievement! They defeated the infamous Bandit King! Everyone ish talking about da Guild now!"
1044998164612,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,"Gotta be honest with ya, Guild Master. *Hic* I thought the Guild was done for. Didn't believe in ya,<waitfor=0.5> <b>at all</b>! 
Just didn't wanna say anything that might have discouraged ya, y'know?"
1044998164613,DIALOGUESCENE59_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"...Well, I guess I can't fault you for thinking that. Although, I would have appreciated it if you had left out the emphasizing tone."
1044998164614,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,"<?shakeSceen>But I was wrong, man! *Hic*. You pulled through and made the Guild great again!"
1044998164615,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE13,"The Guild hash become famous! Bards are singing shongs 'bout our adventurers! Even nobles come to ush with requests now!
If thish isn't a reason to celebrate then nothing ish!"
1044998164616,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,I'm shure...Fran would understand if ya take a break just for today. *hic* Ya both deserve a day off to celebrate with ush!
1045002358784,DIALOGUESCENE59_FIOLA_DIALOGUE15,...
1045002358785,DIALOGUESCENE59_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,...
1045002358786,DIALOGUESCENE59_GILBERT_DIALOGUE17,Ish this were those two were hiding? *Hic*
1045002358787,DIALOGUESCENE59_FIOLA_DIALOGUE18,L-Lord Gilbert! You're still here?
1045002358788,DIALOGUESCENE59_GILBERT_DIALOGUE19,<?shakeScreen>Of course I am! Your adventurers know how to party! *Hic*. 
1045002358789,DIALOGUESCENE59_CECILIA_DIALOGUE20,<?shakeScreen>Brother! You're starting to make a fool out of yourself!
1045002358790,DIALOGUESCENE59_GILBERT_DIALOGUE21,"<?shakeScreen>CECIL! MY LITTLE ANGEL! *Hic*
Give yer brother a little kiss!"
1045002358791,DIALOGUESCENE59_CECILIA_DIALOGUE22,Eeeek! You reek of alcohol brother!
1045002358792,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE23,<?shakeScreen>Alright you two! Ya both coming with me and we'll celebrate till morning. *Hic* And I won't tak'a no for an answer!
1045002358793,DIALOGUESCENE59_FIOLA_DIALOGUE24,...*sighs* I'm going. Someone has to keep an eye on Lady Cecilia. It's apparent that her brother won't be able to.
1045002358794,DIALOGUESCENE59_FIOLA_DIALOGUE25,What about you?
1045002358795,DIALOGUESCENE59_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE26,...I guess my hands are tied on this one. 
1045002358796,DIALOGUESCENE59_FIOLA_DIALOGUE27,I was afraid you'd say that.
1045002358797,DIALOGUESCENE59_FALKEN_DIALOGUE28,<?shakeScreen>Great! Then let's go back and have some fun!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045002358798,DIALOGUESCENE59_GILBERT_DIALOGUE29,YEAH! *Hic* Hahahaha!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045002358799,DIALOGUESCENE59_CECILIA_DIALOGUE30,<?shakeScreen>Brother! Y-You're swaying so much!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045002358800,DIALOGUESCENE60_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045002358801,DIALOGUESCENE60_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,"<?whiteFlash>He was right, you know?"
1045002358802,DIALOGUESCENE60_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Hmmm?
1045002358803,DIALOGUESCENE60_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,About you pulling through. Without you there might have not been a Guild anymore.
1045002358804,DIALOGUESCENE60_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,...Franny was right in choosing you.
1045002358805,DIALOGUESCENE60_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...
1045002358806,DIALOGUESCENE60_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"...I
You..."
1045002358807,DIALOGUESCENE60_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...
1045002358808,DIALOGUESCENE60_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...I'll just take the compliment.
1045002358809,DIALOGUESCENE60_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,What's this? Don't tell me you're starting to get soft on me.
1045002358810,DIALOGUESCENE60_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"I guess, I'm getting old.
Just like you."
1045002358811,DIALOGUESCENE60_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,And there it is!
1045002358812,DIALOGUESCENE61_CULTIST_DIALOGUE1,...
1045002358813,DIALOGUESCENE61_CULTIST_DIALOGUE2,"Milady, we've received news that the Bandit King has been eliminated."
1045002358814,DIALOGUESCENE61_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE3,Has he? How disappointing.
1045002358815,DIALOGUESCENE61_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE4,I guess that's the extent of what you can expect from low-lifes like those bandits. Despite all the powers we gave them.
1045002358816,DIALOGUESCENE61_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE5,But they did bring us a lot of sacrifices. And the bandits' souls also belong to the demon lords now. I bet they didn't expect that when they made the pacts.
1045002358817,DIALOGUESCENE61_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE6,I guess it hasn't been entirely an unfruitful endeavor.
1045002358818,DIALOGUESCENE61_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE7,...Just out of curiosity. Who were the ones who defeated the bandits?
1045002358819,DIALOGUESCENE61_CULTIST_DIALOGUE8,...They say it was the Adventurer Guild.
1045002358820,DIALOGUESCENE61_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE9,...
1045002358821,DIALOGUESCENE61_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE10,...The Adventurer Guild...Again?
1045002358822,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...I don't believe you.
1045002358823,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2," It's all true, Guild Master! Everything happened exactly as I described it."
1045002358824,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...So, you're telling me that the dragon we were hunting turned out to be a half-god with intentions of world destruction."
1045002358825,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"He summoned a legion of greater demons to face the adventurers, and the gods, witnessing their heroism, intervened by sending an army of angels to aid them. "
1045002358826,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Together, they vanquished the dragon, who suddenly had a change of heart, forgetting about world destruction and instead rewarded the adventurers with an orb granting godly powers?"
1045002358827,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE6,"Well, maybe I embellished the story a little."
1045002358828,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,*Sighs*...I'll ask the adventurers later what really happened.
1045002358829,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE8,"<?shakeScreen>But the part about the orb is true! Look, I have it right here!"
1045002358830,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Why is it wrapped in cloth?
1045002358831,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE10,"Every time someone attempts to touch it, the orb forcibly tries to transfer its power and knowledge to the person."
1045002358832,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE11,Which is incredibly painful.
1045002358833,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE12,That's why no one has taken the power yet.
1045002358834,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Interesting. I guess only one person can hold the power?
1045002358835,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE14,"From the little knowledge I gained when I held it,..."
1045002358836,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE15,And before I passed out...
1045002358837,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE16,"The power returns to the orb when the current wielder of it dies or gives it up. Therefore, as long as the Guild keeps it, they'll never lose access to this power."
1045002358838,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,Good to know. I'll keep it for now. I'll later determine if any of the adventurers are suitable candidates to wield this power for the Guild.
1045002358839,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE18,"That sounds like a plan, Guild Master."
1045002358840,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE19,"Meanwhile, I'll be crafting a song about the adventurers' battle with Xenoth, the Dark Dragon God, the World Slayer!"
1045002358841,DIALOGUESCENE62_VINCENT _DIALOGUE20,"<?fadeOutNPC> In a realm where darkness did unfold,
Adventurers brave, their stories untold.
They clashed with Xenoth, the dragon god so grand,..."
1045002358842,DIALOGUESCENE62_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,...
1045002358843,DIALOGUESCENE63_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,"Hey, Guild Master!"
1045002358844,DIALOGUESCENE63_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,Congratulations on your first successful Quest!
1045002358845,DIALOGUESCENE63_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,This was the least of all outcomes.
1045002358846,DIALOGUESCENE63_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,It would have been too much for even yourself if the first Quest we accepted ended in a failure.
1045002358847,DIALOGUESCENE63_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I hope I don't have to hold protocol with you after every Quest we do.
1045002358848,DIALOGUESCENE64_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Alright guys. Let's try to get along.
1045002358849,DIALOGUESCENE64_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"On another note, we came because we wanted to show you the last two places in the Guild."
1045002358850,DIALOGUESCENE64_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"As you already know, most of our resources are collected by our adventurers on their Quests."
1045002358851,DIALOGUESCENE64_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,We use these resources to make our own equipment and potions.
1045002358852,DIALOGUESCENE64_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,"Unfortunately, our former alchemist has left us, so for now we have lost the ability to make potions."
1045002358853,DIALOGUESCENE64_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,But luckily our blacksmith is still with us.
1045002358854,DIALOGUESCENE64_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,Let's give him a visit and see if we have enough resources to make use of.
1045002358855,DIALOGUESCENE65_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Well...that could could have gone better...
1045002358856,DIALOGUESCENE65_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,B-but don't worry!
1045002358857,DIALOGUESCENE65_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,All beginnings are difficult! I'm sure next time we'll successfully complete a Quest!
1045002358858,DIALOGUESCENE65_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,Or it will be the final nail in our coffin.
1045002358859,DIALOGUESCENE65_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,Miss Fiola!
1045002358860,DIALOGUESCENE65_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,Seriously! I hope you'll get your act together and try to do better next time!
1045002358861,DIALOGUESCENE65_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...(The worst part is I can't even argue back.)
1045002358862,DIALOGUESCENE66_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>{PROTAGONIST}!<?shakeScreen><?fadeOutNPC>
1045002358863,DIALOGUESCENE66_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Woah, easy there!

1045002358864,DIALOGUESCENE66_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>And Fiola!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045002358865,DIALOGUESCENE66_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>Hey! Get off of me!
1045002358866,DIALOGUESCENE66_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,"I'm so glad that you're still fine! I was *sniff* so worried!
I didn't know what to do if we were too late."
1045002358867,DIALOGUESCENE66_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6," If anything had happened to you...then I...I...bwaaaaaaaahhh.
<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045002358868,DIALOGUESCENE66_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>C-Calm down! Don't cry into my blouse!
1045002358869,DIALOGUESCENE66_CECILIA_DIALOGUE8,"Hmph! I already told her that there was no need to worry. Of course, the Adventurer Guild wouldn't fall that easily."
1045002358870,DIALOGUESCENE66_GILBERT_DIALOGUE9,Hahaha. Weren't you just as worried? That's why you insisted on coming with us.
1045002358871,DIALOGUESCENE66_CECILIA_DIALOGUE10,<?shakeScreen>Brother!
1045002358872,DIALOGUESCENE66_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,Thanks for coming to our aid. We wouldn't have been able to last much longer without you.
1045002358873,DIALOGUESCENE66_GILBERT_DIALOGUE12,"It's the least we can do for the Adventurer Guild after what you've done for us. Although, it took some convincing on my parents for them to send me."
1045002358874,DIALOGUESCENE66_GILBERT_DIALOGUE13,You should have seen the Divine Messenger and my little sister tear into them when they tried to make excuses.
1045002358875,DIALOGUESCENE66_CECILIA_DIALOGUE14,"You didn't stand idly by either, brother!
I've never seen you talk to father and mother like that."
1045002358876,DIALOGUESCENE66_GILBERT_DIALOGUE15,<?shakeScreen>Bwahahaha! It's not like they had any high opinions of me in the first place.
1045002358877,DIALOGUESCENE66_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,... I really don't know how to repay you for all you've done.
1045002358878,DIALOGUESCENE66_GILBERT_DIALOGUE17,How about with a celebration in your tavern? I'm sure your adventurers would also like to let loose after everything they've gone through.
1045002358879,DIALOGUESCENE66_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE18,*sniff*That sounds like a great idea.*sniff*
1045002358880,DIALOGUESCENE66_FIOLA_DIALOGUE19,"Anything if it gets this crybaby off of me.
<?shakeScreen>Would you please let go?!"
1045002358881,DIALOGUESCENE66_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE20,<?shakeScreen>Neeever! Waahhhh!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045002358882,DIALOGUESCENE67_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,Guild Master?
1045002358883,DIALOGUESCENE67_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Hmm? What's the matter, Eden?"
1045002358884,DIALOGUESCENE67_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,The witch... she has woken up.
1045002358885,DIALOGUESCENE67_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"<?whiteFlash>!!!
..."
1045002358886,DIALOGUESCENE67_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Please, go without me.
I will join you later."
1045002358887,DIALOGUESCENE67_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I have something to do first.
1045002358888,DIALOGUESCENE68_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE1,...
1045002358889,DIALOGUESCENE68_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,How are you?
1045002358890,DIALOGUESCENE68_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE3,...
1045002358891,DIALOGUESCENE68_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...You need to tell us where the Emperor's body is.
1045002358892,DIALOGUESCENE68_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045002358893,DIALOGUESCENE68_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"<?shakeScreen>Didn't you see what he has done? He nearly killed you with a curse to keep himself safe!
He doesn't deserve your loyalty."
1045002358894,DIALOGUESCENE69_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>...That curse...I placed it on myself a long time ago.
1045002358895,DIALOGUESCENE69_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>!!!
1045002358896,DIALOGUESCENE69_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE3,... When I first joined him... many of his followers were against it. No one could trust a girl from a demonic tribe like mine. 
1045002358897,DIALOGUESCENE69_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE4,"So, to prove my loyalty, I placed a curse on myself, and gave the Emperor command over it.
He could end my life whenever he wished to."

...His promise that he would never use it..."
1045002358899,DIALOGUESCENE70_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>I ruined him.
...I made him into the monster he is not."
1045002358900,DIALOGUESCENE70_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE2,"When he was on his deathbed, I should have let him go. Let him die as the greatest person ever known."
1045002358901,DIALOGUESCENE70_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE3,... But I couldn't.
1045002358902,DIALOGUESCENE70_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE4,"... I told him how to extend his life.
I used his love for his subjects against him...
I put him down a road he never wanted."
1045002358903,DIALOGUESCENE70_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE5,"...Since then, as time went on...he became more and more obsessed with the greater good.
...I know he has become mad...I know that this is not the person he wanted to become...
"
1045002358904,DIALOGUESCENE70_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE6,"...But even then I wanted to believe...that the man I once knew was still there...
...That not letting him go was not a mistake..."
1045002358905,DIALOGUESCENE70_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE7,...But it was...And he paid for it.
1045002358906,DIALOGUESCENE70_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...Where is his body?
1045002358907,DIALOGUESCENE70_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...(She waves her hand).
1045002358908,DIALOGUESCENE70_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,(A sudden image came into my mind. A location in the Ashenlands. I was sure that that was the location.)

1045002358910,DIALOGUESCENE71_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE2,...I've betrayed my Emperor. The only reason I continued to live for.
1045002358911,DIALOGUESCENE71_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE3,I'm tired...
1045002358912,DIALOGUESCENE71_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...What was your name?

1045006553092,DIALOGUESCENE73_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE6,...
1045006553093,DIALOGUESCENE73_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE7,Guild Master.

1045006553102,DIALOGUESCENE74_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...It's the witch.

1045006553109,DIALOGUESCENE75_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Hey kid. Are you lost?
1045006553110,DIALOGUESCENE75_CECILIA_DIALOGUE5,...
1045006553111,DIALOGUESCENE75_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,How about we go and find your parents?

1045006553115,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...
1045006553116,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,You mean you're playing house with some boy?
1045006553117,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>W-what?! H-How dare you talk to me like that!
1045006553118,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE7,Y-you....you...

1045006553120,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,(And suddenly I'm reminded again why I don't like kids.)
1045006553121,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE10,Hmph! Whatever! I have no time to waste on the likes of you so I will let your rude behaviour towards me slide this time.
1045006553122,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE11,"More importantly, I have to find the Guild Master of the Adventurer Guild."
1045006553123,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...
1045006553124,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,..I'm the Guild Master.
1045006553125,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE14,<?whiteFlash>...What?
1045006553126,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,I said I am the Guild Master.
1045006553127,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE16,<?shakeScreen>LIAR!
1045006553128,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE17,As if the Guild Master of the Adventurer Guild could be someone as uncouth as you!
1045006553129,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,...And how should the Guild Master of the Adventurer Guild be like in your opinion?
1045006553130,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE19,Obviously the Guild Master would be a highly respectable person who radiates grace and awe wherever they go.
1045006553131,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE20,A prime example of a person for all of the great adventurers to strive for.
1045006553132,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,And what do you think adventurers are?
1045006553133,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE22,Noble and selfless warriors of course. Fighting for justice and against evil.
1045006553134,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,And who told you all that?
1045006553135,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE24,"My big brother. 
He knows everything. "
1045006553136,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE25,Kid...I'm going to say something very upsetting.
1045006553137,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE26,W-what exactly?
1045006553138,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,Your brother lied. None of that is true.
1045006553139,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE28,<?shakeScreen>W-what?! How dare you say that?!
1045006553140,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE29,Noble and selfless? Did you know that people wouldn't let adventurers into their houses because they were afraid they would steal something?
1045006553141,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE30,B-but they fight monsters!
1045006553142,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE31,For money.
1045006553143,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE32,T-they protect people!
1045006553144,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE33,For money.
1045006553145,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE34,"Do you want to know how many times I've seen adventurers skip town before they've done their job?
Even when they got the money?"
1045006553146,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE35,N-no! That can't be. My big brother...
1045006553147,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE36,He lied. And do you know why he lied?
1045006553148,DIALOGUESCENE76_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE37,Because you're a kid.
1045006553149,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE38,W-w...
1045006553150,DIALOGUESCENE76_CECILIA_DIALOGUE39,<?shakeScreen>WAHHHHHHH!!!
1045006553151,DIALOGUESCENE77_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,...What are you doing?
1045006553152,DIALOGUESCENE77_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Fiola...
I've found some lost kid. "
1045006553153,DIALOGUESCENE77_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Try not to eat her.
1045006553154,DIALOGUESCENE77_CECILIA_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreenWeak>*Sniff* E-Eat me?

1045006553157,DIALOGUESCENE77_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"...No, but I get the distinct feeling I'm not going to like the answer."
1045006553158,DIALOGUESCENE78_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>L-lady Cecilia!
1045006553159,DIALOGUESCENE78_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,<size=10>From house Greyhorn. I might add...
1045006553160,DIALOGUESCENE78_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(Oh drat...A noble kid...)
1045006553161,DIALOGUESCENE78_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>I'm terribly sorry if our Guild Master has been in any way disrespectful to you!
1045006553162,DIALOGUESCENE78_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,I'm sure the Guild Master wasn't aware that they were in the presence of a lady like yourself.
1045006553163,DIALOGUESCENE78_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,"Right, Guild Master?"
1045006553164,DIALOGUESCENE78_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Y-yeah.
1045006553165,DIALOGUESCENE78_CECILIA_DIALOGUE8,*Sniff*...
1045006553166,DIALOGUESCENE78_CECILIA_DIALOGUE9,<?whiteFlash>F-finally someone who knows how to treat a lady!
1045006553167,DIALOGUESCENE78_CECILIA_DIALOGUE10,You may be forgiven.
1045006553168,DIALOGUESCENE78_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,(That was a quick recovery.)
1045006553169,DIALOGUESCENE78_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,Lady Cecilia! We're delighted that you decided to grace us with your presence.
1045006553170,DIALOGUESCENE78_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,"But if you don't mind me asking, what is the reason for this happy occasion?"
1045006553171,DIALOGUESCENE79_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045006553172,DIALOGUESCENE79_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,...I need adventurers for a Quest.
1045006553173,DIALOGUESCENE79_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,....
1045006553174,DIALOGUESCENE79_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,We should talk somewhere else.
1045006553175,DIALOGUESCENE80_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Alright kid. Tell me what this is all about.
1045006553176,DIALOGUESCENE80_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>Stop calling me a kid!
1045006553177,DIALOGUESCENE80_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,Guild Master....
1045006553178,DIALOGUESCENE80_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Alright, alright!"
1045006553179,DIALOGUESCENE80_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Lady Cecilia,..."
1045006553180,DIALOGUESCENE80_CECILIA_DIALOGUE6,Much better.
1045006553181,DIALOGUESCENE80_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...for what reason have you sought the Adventurer Guild?
1045006553182,DIALOGUESCENE80_CECILIA_DIALOGUE8,...
1045006553183,DIALOGUESCENE80_CECILIA_DIALOGUE9,<?whiteFlash>...I want you to save my big brother.
1045006553184,DIALOGUESCENE80_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...What do you mean?
1045006553185,DIALOGUESCENE80_CECILIA_DIALOGUE11,"As you know, the bandit problem in our lands has gotten out of hand as of late and it's believed to be the cause of a self-proclaimed Bandit King."
1045006553186,DIALOGUESCENE80_CECILIA_DIALOGUE12,"As response, my family sent a subjugation force led by my big brother to deal with the Bandit King and his men."
1045006553187,DIALOGUESCENE80_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"(Ah, right. I think I remember hearing about the subjugation force.)"
1045006553188,DIALOGUESCENE80_CECILIA_DIALOGUE14,...
1045006553189,DIALOGUESCENE81_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,...But they failed.
1045006553190,DIALOGUESCENE81_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>W-what?
1045006553191,DIALOGUESCENE81_CECILIA_DIALOGUE3,"Yesterday, some soldiers managed to return and told us that the bandits under the Bandit King's command were much more numerous and stronger than we thought. "
1045006553192,DIALOGUESCENE81_CECILIA_DIALOGUE4,The subjugation force was completely routed.
1045006553193,DIALOGUESCENE81_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,That's some rather unsettling news...
1045006553194,DIALOGUESCENE81_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(I would have never expected to hear that bandits could become this much of a threat.)
1045006553195,DIALOGUESCENE82_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,And your brother?
1045006553196,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,...He's missing...
1045006553197,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>...B-But I'm sure he's alive!
1045006553198,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE4,They said he was the one who called for the retreat!
1045006553199,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE5,He is still alive for sure...
1045006553200,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>Please Guild Master!
1045006553201,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>I know he is still out there! 
I need your adventurers to seach for him! "
1045006553202,DIALOGUESCENE82_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,What about your family? Haven't they sent their own men to find your brother?
1045006553203,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE9,...They won't look for him.
1045006553204,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE10,He is the fourth son of the family...
1045006553205,DIALOGUESCENE82_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,"So, not important enough to risk more men for a search party."
1045006553206,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE12,...Yes...
1045006553207,DIALOGUESCENE82_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,(Nobles. That's why I don't like dealing with them.)
1045006553208,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE14,"My family wouldn't even allow me to hire adventurers to search for him, saying that adventurers are just untrustworthy lowlifes."
1045006553209,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE15,But my brother always told me that adventurers always help people in need. I even heard how the Adventurer Guild saved a village from the Bandit King.
1045006553210,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE16,That's why I snuck out of my home with some trusted servants just to meet you.
1045006553211,DIALOGUESCENE82_FALKEN_DIALOGUE17,That explains those people panicking in the tavern just a moment ago.
1045006553212,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE18,Please! I need your adventurers to look for my brother!
1045006553213,DIALOGUESCENE82_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,"(It has been days since the battle, hasn't it?)"
1045006553214,DIALOGUESCENE82_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,"(If he hasn't returned by now, I fear he might already be....)"
1045006553215,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE21,"I-is it about the money? You said adventurers would help for money, right?"
1045006553216,DIALOGUESCENE82_CECILIA_DIALOGUE22,"I-I don't have any money, b-but... "
1045006553217,DIALOGUESCENE82_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045006553218,DIALOGUESCENE83_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,I-I can give you this.
1045006553219,DIALOGUESCENE83_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,It's a ring that my nanny once gave me. It's supposed to protect me.
1045006553220,DIALOGUESCENE83_CECILIA_DIALOGUE3,B-but I don't need to be protected. I-I just want my brother back...
1045006553221,DIALOGUESCENE83_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,(...)
1045006553222,DIALOGUESCENE83_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(An old ring made out of cheap metal. Something a noble would be embarassed to be seen with.)
1045006553223,DIALOGUESCENE83_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"(Yet contrary to that haughtiness she was displaying in the beginning, she was still wearing this cheap ring)"
1045006553224,DIALOGUESCENE83_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,(It has to mean a lot to her.)
1045006553225,DIALOGUESCENE84_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Okay kid. 
The Adventurer Guild will accept your Quest."
1045010747392,DIALOGUESCENE84_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,"Really? Oh, thank you! Thank you!"
1045010747393,DIALOGUESCENE85_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>Eh,..I mean..."
1045010747394,DIALOGUESCENE85_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,Of course you will! 
1045010747395,DIALOGUESCENE85_CECILIA_DIALOGUE3,And did you just call me a kid again?!!
1045010747396,DIALOGUESCENE85_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,(And for a moment I thought she was cute.)
1045010747397,DIALOGUESCENE85_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,...
1045010747398,DIALOGUESCENE85_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...What?
1045010747399,DIALOGUESCENE85_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,You know that that ring is probably not worth much and you still accepted the Quest.
1045010747400,DIALOGUESCENE85_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,I guess you do have a kinder side after all.
1045010747401,DIALOGUESCENE85_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,"Well, even if we take a loss on this Quest, we can just easily make up the difference from the Guild Master's pocket."
1045010747402,DIALOGUESCENE85_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...You two are talking too much.
1045010747403,DIALOGUESCENE85_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,Let's get back to work. We have a big brother to find.
1045010747404,DIALOGUESCENE86_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,{PROTAGONIST}...
1045010747405,DIALOGUESCENE86_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Fiola...
1045010747406,DIALOGUESCENE86_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,Wow. The mood turned cold all of a sudden.
1045010747407,DIALOGUESCENE86_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"I heard the Adventurers have found our ""ghost""."
1045010747408,DIALOGUESCENE86_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,They did....She is over there.
1045010747409,DIALOGUESCENE86_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,...
1045010747410,DIALOGUESCENE86_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...Are you...?
1045010747411,DIALOGUESCENE87_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>I'M SORRY! THIS IS ALL I HAVE I SWEAR!
1045010747412,DIALOGUESCENE87_EMILY_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>TAKE IT AND LET ME LEAVE PLEASE!
1045010747413,DIALOGUESCENE87_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,She has been like this ever since we got her here.
1045010747414,DIALOGUESCENE87_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I guess this is what happens when kids have to spend too much time with you. They instinctively realize that you're actually a child eating witch.
1045010747415,DIALOGUESCENE87_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,"Hmph! I bet it was your ugly mug, that made her scared for her life."
1045010747416,DIALOGUESCENE87_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Don't bring my pretty face into this. You know as well as I do that I'm at least an 8 out of 10.
1045010747417,DIALOGUESCENE87_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,Pfft. Amongst pigs perhaps. 
1045010747418,DIALOGUESCENE87_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,At least I'm not trying to hide my age behind makeups.
1045010747419,DIALOGUESCENE87_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>WHAT!!?
1045010747420,DIALOGUESCENE87_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"Oh, don't act like that. I'm pretty sure everyone knows about it."
1045010747421,DIALOGUESCENE87_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,You take that back!
1045010747422,DIALOGUESCENE87_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Make me!
1045010747423,DIALOGUESCENE87_TAVI_DIALOGUE13,Uhm...guys?
1045010747424,DIALOGUESCENE87_FIOLA_DIALOGUE14,<?shakeScreen>PIG!!!
1045010747425,DIALOGUESCENE87_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,<?shakeScreen>HAG!!!
1045010747426,DIALOGUESCENE87_TAVI_DIALOGUE16,GUYS!!!
1045010747427,DIALOGUESCENE87_FIOLA_DIALOGUE17,<?shakeScreen>WHAT!!??
1045010747428,DIALOGUESCENE88_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Yikes!
1045010747429,DIALOGUESCENE88_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,I-I just wanted to say that you're scaring the girl.
1045010747430,DIALOGUESCENE88_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(Is she hiding under a table?).
1045010747431,DIALOGUESCENE88_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,...
1045010747432,DIALOGUESCENE88_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,"Come out, kid! There is nothing to fear."
1045010747433,DIALOGUESCENE88_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>A-are you going to sell me off now?
1045010747434,DIALOGUESCENE88_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>What? Of course not!
1045010747435,DIALOGUESCENE88_EMILY_DIALOGUE8,"But you're adventurers, are you not?"
1045010747436,DIALOGUESCENE88_TAVI_DIALOGUE9,Kid....what do you think adventurers are?
1045010747437,DIALOGUESCENE88_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,A different word for bandits?
1045010747438,DIALOGUESCENE88_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,(We really have an image problem...)
1045010747439,DIALOGUESCENE88_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,I don't know what you've heard about us but we won't do anything to you.
1045010747440,DIALOGUESCENE88_EMILY_DIALOGUE13,Really?
1045010747441,DIALOGUESCENE88_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Really. 
1045010747442,DIALOGUESCENE88_EMILY_DIALOGUE15,...
1045010747443,DIALOGUESCENE88_EMILY_DIALOGUE16,So...adventurers aren't bad guys?
1045010747444,DIALOGUESCENE88_FIOLA_DIALOGUE17,"Well, if you disregard this person here amongst us."
1045010747445,DIALOGUESCENE88_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,You stay out of this!
1045010747446,DIALOGUESCENE88_TAVI_DIALOGUE19,"Well it's true, that adventurers are a rough bunch of people but most rumors about them are greatly exaggerated. They aren't highway men so there is nothing to be afraid of."
1045010747447,DIALOGUESCENE88_EMILY_DIALOGUE20,...
1045010747448,DIALOGUESCENE89_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>That's a relief. I really thought I was in hot water this time.
1045010747449,DIALOGUESCENE89_EMILY_DIALOGUE2,I'm really sorry about my behaviour but my mother used to warn me about adventurers.
1045010747450,DIALOGUESCENE89_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,She would always tell me how adventurers would always keep trespassing into her house and take things that aren't theirs. Or how they always respond with violence to everything.
1045010747451,DIALOGUESCENE89_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,I guess those stories weren't true after all.
1045010747452,DIALOGUESCENE89_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(...Let's not burst the bubble.)
1045010747453,DIALOGUESCENE89_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Anyway, the reason the adventurers brought you here was that someone has been causing a disturbance very close to the Adventurer Guild. I guess that was you, right?"
1045010747454,DIALOGUESCENE89_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,I'm sorry. I didn't want to cause a commotion.
1045010747455,DIALOGUESCENE89_EMILY_DIALOGUE8,But I was scared of bandits so whenever someone approached me I put them to sleep with one of my potions.
1045010747456,DIALOGUESCENE89_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,Potions? Now that I look at you...are you by any chance an alchemist?
1045010747457,DIALOGUESCENE89_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,That's right! Emily is the name and potion making is my game! I'm from a family that has been producing respectable alchemists for centuries now!
1045010747458,DIALOGUESCENE89_EMILY_DIALOGUE11,Or at least that's what my parents always said.
1045010747459,DIALOGUESCENE90_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I see. Then I have only one question left.
1045010747460,DIALOGUESCENE90_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What were you doing all alone in the nearby woods? From what I heard you've probably been roaming there for weeks now.
1045010747461,DIALOGUESCENE90_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,...The truth is I'm searching for something...something that I believe is hidden somewhere here.
1045010747462,DIALOGUESCENE90_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,And what would that be?
1045010747463,DIALOGUESCENE90_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,It's a rare plant. Something I've been looking for for a very long time now.
1045010747464,DIALOGUESCENE90_TAVI_DIALOGUE6,"<?shakeScreen>You've been wandering the woods for weeks just to find a plant? Don't you know how dangerous the forest here is? Especially, when you're going alone!"
1045010747465,DIALOGUESCENE90_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,...I know...but I still need to search for it.
1045010747466,DIALOGUESCENE90_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...
1045010747467,DIALOGUESCENE91_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...Then how about you try to look for it from here?
1045010747468,DIALOGUESCENE91_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"It would be safer than just wandering around the forest on your own. And if you want to look for that plant, we can have at least some adventurers escort you to keep you safe."
1045010747469,DIALOGUESCENE91_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,B-But I really don't have that much money to pay for lodging and protection...
1045010747470,DIALOGUESCENE91_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,Then why don't you work for us instead?
1045010747471,DIALOGUESCENE91_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,Didn't you say yourself that you're an alchemist? 
1045010747472,DIALOGUESCENE91_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,As it happens we do need an alchemist and we also have a building you could move into.
1045010747473,DIALOGUESCENE91_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,What's this? You can be nice to somebody?
1045010747474,DIALOGUESCENE91_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,"As long as that somebody isn't you, I can be an angel."
1045010747475,DIALOGUESCENE91_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"So how about it? If you want, you can stay with us and we help you with your search. In exchange you work for us as an alchemist and make some potions for our adventurers."
1045010747476,DIALOGUESCENE91_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,What do you say?
1045010747477,DIALOGUESCENE91_EMILY_DIALOGUE11,O-Of course I'll accept! Thank you very much!
1045010747478,DIALOGUESCENE91_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"Alright.
Welcome to the Adventurer Guild, Emily."
1045010747479,DIALOGUESCENE91_EMILY_DIALOGUE13,Thank you all! I really appreciate it.
1045010747480,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,Oh! Hello Guild Master!
1045010747481,DIALOGUESCENE92_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Hello Emily. I was just wondering how you're fitting in. 
1045010747482,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,Everything is great here!
1045010747483,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,"This place is much bigger than the workstations I've usually worked with and there are a lot of ingredients here, I can't wait to try out!"
1045010747484,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,And best of all: I can finally sleep on a bed again.
1045010747485,DIALOGUESCENE92_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...You don't exactly look like the adventurous type. Have you really been living the last few weeks on your own in the forest?
1045010747486,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,It wasn't as bad as you might think. I'm fully capable of surviving on my own in the wilderness.
1045010747487,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE8,"After all, I'm an alchemist and there is a potion for every situation."
1045010747488,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE9,If there was any danger I could easily use one of my potions to get away. If I got sick I could also use a potion to nurse myself back to health.
1045010747489,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,If I was hungry or thirsty I would just drink a potion. If I couldn't sleep because the ground was too hard I just drink a potion to put myself to sleep.
1045010747490,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE11,I even have a laughing potion when I feel down.
1045010747491,DIALOGUESCENE92_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"(I guess that explains the maniacal laughter, people have been reporting..)"
1045010747492,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE13,"Thanks again, Guild Master. 
For offering me a place to stay and helping me in my search."
1045010747493,DIALOGUESCENE92_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,We both benefit from this arrangement. I'm curious how good your potion making skills really are.
1045010747494,DIALOGUESCENE92_EMILY_DIALOGUE15,Then how about I show it to you? Let's make potions!
1045010747495,DIALOGUESCENE93_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,"Apparently another group of travellers has encountered ""her""."
1045010747496,DIALOGUESCENE93_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,So after two weeks it's still happening.
1045010747497,DIALOGUESCENE93_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,*Sighs*. I guess I have no choice but to tell {PROTAGONIST} about it.
1045010747498,DIALOGUESCENE93_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Tell me about what?
1045010747499,DIALOGUESCENE93_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,Just when I mention you. It's like speaking of the devil.
1045010747500,DIALOGUESCENE93_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,But now that you're here you should know that there have been a few incidents close to the Guild.
1045010747501,DIALOGUESCENE93_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...What kind of incidents?
1045010747502,DIALOGUESCENE93_TAVI_DIALOGUE8,Lately some of the travelers who visited the tavern have been talking about seeing a strange girl in the nearby forest.
1045010747503,DIALOGUESCENE93_TAVI_DIALOGUE9,"The story always goes like this:
They first hear a maniacal laughter in the forest and those who are brave enough will then start to look for the source."
1045010747504,DIALOGUESCENE93_TAVI_DIALOGUE10,"When they find the source, it would always turn out to be a girl with blue hair."
1045010747505,DIALOGUESCENE93_TAVI_DIALOGUE11,But when they try to approach the girl they would always pass out for some mysterious reason.
1045010747506,DIALOGUESCENE93_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Kinda sounds like a ghost story...
1045010747507,DIALOGUESCENE93_TAVI_DIALOGUE13,Oh gods...please don't let it be the ghost of a little girl.
1045010747508,DIALOGUESCENE93_TAVI_DIALOGUE14,That would be too depressing...
1045010747509,DIALOGUESCENE93_FIOLA_DIALOGUE15,"Well, whatever it is, until now all travelers have regained their consciousness on the road and were unharmed. So it might be harmless."
1045010747510,DIALOGUESCENE93_FIOLA_DIALOGUE16,Still it might be a good idea to send some adventurers to investigate it as an <b>Assignment</b>.
1045010747511,DIALOGUESCENE93_FIOLA_DIALOGUE17,"If you don't have any adventurers available, hire more in the tavern."
1045010747512,DIALOGUESCENE93_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,It does sound like a good idea...
1045010747513,DIALOGUESCENE93_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,...despite it coming from you.
1045010747514,DIALOGUESCENE94_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,"Was nice talking to you, Guild Master!"
1045010747515,DIALOGUESCENE95_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,"Anything else, Guild Master?"
1045010747516,DIALOGUESCENE96_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,Hello Guild Master! How can I help?
1045010747517,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"When we found you, you said you were looking for a certain plant."
1045010747518,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What is it and why is it so important to you that you kept living in the forest for so long?
1045010747519,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,Promise me you won't laugh.
1045010747520,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...I guess I can promise that.
1045010747521,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,I'm looking for the Flower of Eternity.
1045014941696,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,The Flower of Eternity?
1045014941697,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,The Flower of Eternity is a legendary plant. It is a gorgeous flower that never withers and has existed since the dawn of creation.
1045014941698,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE8, It's said that the Alchemists who were able to find one of the flowers were able to create potions with miraculous effects.
1045014941699,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,....I see. And I guess the laughable part about that is...
1045014941700,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,...The Flower of Eternity is considered a folktale amongst alchemists. Most alchemists don't believe that it exists. Those who believe are generally laughed at.
1045014941701,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE11,B-BUT I know it exists!
1045014941702,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Why do you think that?
1045014941703,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE13,"Because of the diary of one of my ancestors. He was also looking for the flower of Eternity and it seems like he has actually found the location of the flower. 
"
1045014941704,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE14,"Unfortunately most of what was written in the diary has been lost to time so I was only able to narrow down the location, where he has found the flower, to the general area around here."
1045014941705,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,If that's the case wouldn't he already have picked the flower?
1045014941706,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE16,"I don't think so. If he had, then that should have been mentioned in the diary. It should have changed his life."
1045014941707,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE17,But nothing of that sort is mentioned in his diary. The latter part is mostly just mundane descriptions of his everyday life.
1045014941708,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE18,I can only theorize that he never brought the flower with him back home for some reason.
1045014941709,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,So what do you intend to do with it when you find it?
1045014941710,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE20,Make a Potion of course!
1045014941711,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE21,Who knows what kind of Potion you could make with the Flower of Eternity! 
1045014941712,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE22,They say it has miraculous properties so the potion you could make with it should be unlike anything ever seen before.
1045014941713,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,I see. If you do go out searching for it again then tell me so that I can assign some adventurers to escort you.
1045014941714,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE24,"Thanks again for the help, Guild Master! I really appreciate it!"
1045014941715,DIALOGUESCENE97_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE25,Show me your appreciation by continuing to make potions for our adventurers.
1045014941716,DIALOGUESCENE97_EMILY_DIALOGUE26,Will do Guild Master!
1045014941717,DIALOGUESCENE98_ALISSA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045014941718,DIALOGUESCENE98_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"...Yeah, that was a stupid question."
1045014941719,DIALOGUESCENE98_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...My name is {PROTAGONIST}.
I'm the Guild Master here."
1045014941720,DIALOGUESCENE98_ALISSA_DIALOGUE4,...
1045014941721,DIALOGUESCENE98_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,What is your name?
1045014941722,DIALOGUESCENE98_ALISSA_DIALOGUE6,...
1045014941723,DIALOGUESCENE98_ALISSA_DIALOGUE7,...Alissa...
1045014941724,DIALOGUESCENE98_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Alissa...do you still have family?
1045014941725,DIALOGUESCENE98_ALISSA_DIALOGUE9,...
1045014941726,DIALOGUESCENE99_ALISSA_DIALOGUE1,No...*sniff*
1045014941727,DIALOGUESCENE99_ALISSA_DIALOGUE2,They were everything I have.
1045014941728,DIALOGUESCENE99_ALISSA_DIALOGUE3,My father...
1045014941729,DIALOGUESCENE99_ALISSA_DIALOGUE4,My mother...
1045014941730,DIALOGUESCENE99_ALISSA_DIALOGUE5,"And my older brother...
All gone..."
1045014941731,DIALOGUESCENE99_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...
1045014941732,DIALOGUESCENE99_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...I talked with a priest from the church of Ghanenta.
1045014941733,DIALOGUESCENE99_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"If you have nowhere else to go, then they would be able to take you in."
1045014941734,DIALOGUESCENE99_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"You would leave your old life behind and start a new life.
And with time, the pain will become a faint memory."
1045014941735,DIALOGUESCENE99_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...Is that alright with you?
1045014941736,DIALOGUESCENE99_ALISSA_DIALOGUE11,...
1045014941737,DIALOGUESCENE99_ALISSA_DIALOGUE12,...I-I don't know...
1045014941738,DIALOGUESCENE99_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,(She is probably too numb from everything that has happened to make a decision.)
1045014941739,DIALOGUESCENE100_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...I think you should go with them.
1045014941740,DIALOGUESCENE100_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Your family would probably want you to be safe and sound.
1045014941741,DIALOGUESCENE100_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,And this path might give you the best chance for happiness.
1045014941742,DIALOGUESCENE100_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Even if now it seems like you'll never be again.
1045014941743,DIALOGUESCENE100_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045014941744,DIALOGUESCENE100_ALISSA_DIALOGUE6,...Okay...
1045014941745,DIALOGUESCENE100_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,I wish you all the best for the future.
1045014941746,DIALOGUESCENE101_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Then take your time.
1045014941747,DIALOGUESCENE101_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It's not like you have to make a decision now.
1045014941748,DIALOGUESCENE101_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Just think about it.
Maybe you'll find a better path on your own."
1045014941749,DIALOGUESCENE101_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,You can stay as long as you want until you've made a decision.
1045014941750,DIALOGUESCENE101_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045014941751,DIALOGUESCENE101_ALISSA_DIALOGUE6,...Thank you...
1045014941752,DIALOGUESCENE102_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045014941753,DIALOGUESCENE103_ALISSA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045014941754,DIALOGUESCENE104_ALISSA_DIALOGUE1,...Hello Guild Master.
1045014941755,DIALOGUESCENE104_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Oh, hello Alissa."
1045014941756,DIALOGUESCENE104_ALISSA_DIALOGUE3,"I...wanted to talk to you.
...About what we talked about."
1045014941757,DIALOGUESCENE104_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"I see...
So you made your decision."
1045014941758,DIALOGUESCENE104_ALISSA_DIALOGUE5,Yes...
1045014941759,DIALOGUESCENE104_ALISSA_DIALOGUE6,I...
1045014941760,DIALOGUESCENE104_ALISSA_DIALOGUE7,I want to be an adventurer.
1045014941761,DIALOGUESCENE104_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?whiteFlash>...What?
1045014941762,DIALOGUESCENE104_ALISSA_DIALOGUE9,...
1045014941763,DIALOGUESCENE104_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"...You're serious, aren't you?"
1045014941764,DIALOGUESCENE104_ALISSA_DIALOGUE11,Yes.
1045014941765,DIALOGUESCENE104_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,I'm not sure what to say...Have you really thought this through? Being an adventurer is not exactly an easy life and I'm sure your parents would have wanted more for you.
1045014941766,DIALOGUESCENE104_ALISSA_DIALOGUE13,...
1045014941767,DIALOGUESCENE105_ALISSA_DIALOGUE1,...I can't stop thinking about what happened that day.
1045014941768,DIALOGUESCENE105_ALISSA_DIALOGUE2,When the bandits appeared before us. The screams of people when they started killing. Their laughter while doing so...
1045014941769,DIALOGUESCENE105_ALISSA_DIALOGUE3,"Every night I wake up terrified from my nightmares, reliving the events of that day. "
1045014941770,DIALOGUESCENE105_ALISSA_DIALOGUE4,"And in the times I'm awake, I'm afraid of every sound I hear and every stranger I see. "
1045014941771,DIALOGUESCENE105_ALISSA_DIALOGUE5,"The world has become such a dark place and it frightens me...
It felt like...my life would never be alright again..."
1045014941772,DIALOGUESCENE105_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...
1045014941773,DIALOGUESCENE105_ALISSA_DIALOGUE7,"But...when your adventurers saved that village from the bandits, for the first time in a long time I felt...hopeful."
1045014941774,DIALOGUESCENE105_ALISSA_DIALOGUE8,"...I...<?shakeScreen>I don't want to feel afraid anymore, Guild Master!  I want to be strong like an adventurer. Strong enough that I could have saved them. "
1045014941775,DIALOGUESCENE105_ALISSA_DIALOGUE9,Please Guild Master...Let me join you.
1045014941776,DIALOGUESCENE106_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...I understand. If you think that's what is best for you I won't stop you.
1045014941777,DIALOGUESCENE106_ALISSA_DIALOGUE2,"Thank you, Guild Master!"
1045014941778,DIALOGUESCENE106_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"(Hopefully, I won't get haunted by her family for this decision)."
1045014941779,DIALOGUESCENE107_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...I'm sorry Alissa but I can not let you join.
1045014941780,DIALOGUESCENE107_ALISSA_DIALOGUE2,B-but...
1045014941781,DIALOGUESCENE107_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I won't change my mind.
1045014941782,DIALOGUESCENE107_ALISSA_DIALOGUE4,...
1045014941783,DIALOGUESCENE107_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...Just try to live your life in peace. I'm sure that's what your family would have wanted for you.
1045014941784,DIALOGUESCENE107_ALISSA_DIALOGUE6,I...
1045014941785,DIALOGUESCENE107_ALISSA_DIALOGUE7,I'm sorry! I have to go!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045014941786,DIALOGUESCENE107_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,(...This is for the best.)
1045014941787,DIALOGUESCENE107_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,(I'll tell Eden that they should bring her away as soon as possible.)
1045014941788,DIALOGUESCENE107_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...Farewell Alissa.
1045014941789,DIALOGUESCENE108_ALISSA_DIALOGUE1,Hello Guild Master.
1045014941790,DIALOGUESCENE108_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Hello Alissa. What can I do for you?
1045014941791,DIALOGUESCENE108_ALISSA_DIALOGUE3,...I heard there was a Quest against the Bandit King.
1045014941792,DIALOGUESCENE108_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Word really spread fast here, don't they?
But it's true. We received a Quest to help fight the Bandit King."
1045014941793,DIALOGUESCENE108_ALISSA_DIALOGUE5,If possible...I would like to take part in that Quest.
1045014941794,DIALOGUESCENE108_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...I see.
1045014941795,DIALOGUESCENE108_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,I'll think about it.
1045014941796,DIALOGUESCENE108_ALISSA_DIALOGUE8,"Thank you, Guild Master."
1045014941797,DIALOGUESCENE109_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,"So, we finally found all the pieces."
1045014941798,DIALOGUESCENE109_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,What do we do now?
1045014941799,DIALOGUESCENE109_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,According to Majika it would be enough to put the pieces back together and it would start showing the location of its counterpart.
1045014941800,DIALOGUESCENE109_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,Let's do it then!
1045014941801,DIALOGUESCENE110_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,(It started to float.)
1045014941802,DIALOGUESCENE110_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,I guess the direction it's pointing at is the direction where the witch most likely resides.
1045014941803,DIALOGUESCENE111_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,Then what are we waiting for? We should head there immediately!
1045014941804,DIALOGUESCENE111_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Not so fast!
1045014941805,DIALOGUESCENE111_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,We should prepare first. We're about to go deep into the enemy's base after all.
1045014941806,DIALOGUESCENE111_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I doubt they will let us in without a fight. Our adventurers need to be ready.
1045014941807,DIALOGUESCENE111_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,"...Very well, Guild Master. I'll trust your judgement. Whenever you think you're ready, just tell me."
1045014941808,DIALOGUESCENE111_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,"I...just want it to be resolved as quickly as possible.
"
1045014941809,DIALOGUESCENE112_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045014941810,DIALOGUESCENE112_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"""Nothing is going to..."""
1045014941811,DIALOGUESCENE112_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>I don't want to hear it!
1045014941812,DIALOGUESCENE112_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I hope at least the reason for this quest was worth risking the life of our Adventurers over.
1045014941813,DIALOGUESCENE112_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>Wait! Don't tell me you just wanted some flowers for yourself?
1045014941814,DIALOGUESCENE112_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,*sighs* They're not for me.
1045014941815,DIALOGUESCENE112_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,They're for Tavi. From her husband...
1045014941816,DIALOGUESCENE112_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?whiteFlash>!
1045014941817,DIALOGUESCENE112_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,Just bring them to her.
1045014941818,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,Oh! Hello Guild Master!
1045014941819,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,What can I do for you?
1045014941820,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I got some flowers here that are meant for you.
1045014941821,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>Oh...
1045014941822,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,These are...rainbow flowers...
1045014941823,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE6,I...wasn't sure I'd get any this year...
1045014941824,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Fiola told me to get some but never told me it was for you.
1045014941825,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE8,"Hahaha, she probably thought if you knew what they were really for, you wouldn't deem it important enough to do it. She is sometimes thoughtful like that."
1045014941826,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...They're from your husband I heard...
1045014941827,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE10,...Yeah...
1045014941828,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE11,...He forgot our anniversary once and I was so angry at him I didn't talk to him for a whole week.
1045014941829,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE12,"As an apology, he paid the Guild to gather rainbow flowers for me every anniversary, so I'd have a gift even if he forgot."
1045014941830,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE13,...I really miss my big old dork...
1045014941831,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...
1045014941832,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE15,"Nevertheless, thank you for the flowers, Guild Master! I hope it wasn't too much of a bother to collect them."
1045014941833,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,...
1045014941834,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE17,"Oh gods. It was, wasn't it?"
1045014941835,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,...Well...
1045014941836,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,(After a short explanation...)
1045019136000,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE20,<?shakeScreen>A hostile tree?! Now I feel bad for the adventurers.
1045019136001,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,Don't worry about it. They've gone through much worse.
1045019136002,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE22,But even so...
1045019136003,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE23,"<?whiteFlash>I know! Wait here for a second, Guild Master!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045019136004,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,(I wonder what she's up to...)
1045019136005,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE25,Hnnngh!....Why is this so heavy?
1045019136006,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE26,<?shakeScreen>Phew! This thing weighs a ton!
1045019136007,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,<?whiteFlash>This is...an armor.
1045019136008,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE28,"This used to belong to my husband! Don't let my husband's death fool you. This is some fine armor, you'll rarely find anywhere."
1045019136009,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE29,The Guild can have it. As thanks for the flowers.
1045019136010,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE30,"Are you sure about that? This armor is important to you, isn't it?"
1045019136011,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE31,"...I'd be lying if I said no, but the adventurers deserved it."
1045019136012,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE32,"And besides, armor should be used to protect people! Not to collect dust in some widow's room."
1045019136013,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE33,I'm sure he would be happy if his armor could save an adventurer's life. He was very fond of the Guild after all.
1045019136014,DIALOGUESCENE113_TAVI_DIALOGUE34,And so am I.
1045019136015,DIALOGUESCENE113_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE35,Thank you Tavi. I promise I will put it to good use.
1045019136016,DIALOGUESCENE114_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045019136017,DIALOGUESCENE114_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Hello, I guess you're Rogue's friend."
1045019136018,DIALOGUESCENE114_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,"If she is who I think she is, then yes. I'm her friend."
1045019136019,DIALOGUESCENE114_LUANA_DIALOGUE4,"And I assume that you're the one who has sent those adventurers to help me.
I'm grateful for that."
1045019136020,DIALOGUESCENE114_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,It's alright. 
1045019136021,DIALOGUESCENE114_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(She seems to be a bit more open than Rogue. Maybe I can finally learn something from her.)
1045019136022,DIALOGUESCENE114_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"So, what's your name and how did you get to know Rogue?"
1045019136023,DIALOGUESCENE114_LUANA_DIALOGUE8,"Well, I'm..."
1045019136024,DIALOGUESCENE114_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,<?whiteFlash>Luana!
1045019136025,DIALOGUESCENE115_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Are you fine? Did they hurt you?
1045019136026,DIALOGUESCENE115_LUANA_DIALOGUE2,I'm fine!
1045019136027,DIALOGUESCENE115_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,Are you sure?
1045019136028,DIALOGUESCENE115_LUANA_DIALOGUE4, Really! You don't have to worry.
1045019136029,DIALOGUESCENE115_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"(...Well, this is an unexpected reaction.)"
1045019136030,DIALOGUESCENE115_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"(...She really was worried, wasn't she?)"
1045019136031,DIALOGUESCENE116_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I see you returned as well.
1045019136032,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,"Yeah, my place turned out to be a dud."
1045019136033,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,"The only ones waiting for me there, were some old acquaintances I had to take care of."
1045019136034,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,That reminds me...
1045019136035,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,Did the adventurers take care of all the ones on their end?
1045019136036,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE6,Don't worry. I took care of it.
1045019136037,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE7," ""They"" shouldn't know that the Adventurers Guild has helped me."
1045019136038,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>That's Luana for you! I should have expected nothing less from you!
1045019136039,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,...
1045019136040,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,"...Why are you staring at me like that, Guild Master?"
1045019136041,DIALOGUESCENE116_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,<?whiteFlash>Am I?
1045019136042,DIALOGUESCENE116_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"Sorry, I just thought that..."
1045019136043,DIALOGUESCENE116_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"...you really care about her, don't you?"
1045019136044,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE14,<?shakeScreen>W-wait. W-what are you implying? It's not what you're thinking!
1045019136045,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE15,Are you saying you don't care about me...
1045019136046,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE16,<?shakeScreen>No! No! I didn't mean that! I-I...
1045019136047,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE17,I'm just kidding of course!
1045019136048,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE18,<?shakeScreenWeak>Ungghh...
1045019136049,DIALOGUESCENE116_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,"(I'm pretty sure if she wasn't hiding her face, we would be seeing a pretty red face right now.)"
1045019136050,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE20,Guild Master.
1045019136051,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE21,"Again, I like to thank you for your help."
1045019136052,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE22,And also thank you for keeping a dear friend of mine safe.
1045019136053,DIALOGUESCENE116_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,"Well, the latter is more of a decision of my predecessor than mine."
1045019136054,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE24,"Nevertheless, thank you."
1045019136055,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE25,"If you allow it, I'd like to stay here with Rogue."
1045019136056,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE26,Just like her I can offer you to teach your adventurers the skills I learned during my life.
1045019136057,DIALOGUESCENE116_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,I heard about it from my adventurers. A warrior capable of casting spells. A very rare combination.
1045019136058,DIALOGUESCENE116_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE28,I'd be a fool to object to that.
1045019136059,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE29,Thank you Guild Master.
1045019136060,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE30,"Seems like we will be together for a while ""Rogue""."
1045019136061,DIALOGUESCENE116_LUANA_DIALOGUE31,I really missed you.
1045019136062,DIALOGUESCENE116_ROGUE_DIALOGUE32,"...
<?whiteFlash><size=12>*mumble* I missed you too...</size>"
1045019136063,DIALOGUESCENE117_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Guild Master! We need to talk!
1045019136064,DIALOGUESCENE117_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(That doesn't sound good.)
1045019136065,DIALOGUESCENE117_ASTRID_DIALOGUE3,I need some of the adventurers to help me do something.
1045019136066,DIALOGUESCENE117_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Help you with what?
1045019136067,DIALOGUESCENE117_ASTRID_DIALOGUE5,To kill somebody!
1045019136068,DIALOGUESCENE117_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"...Astrid, maybe you need to calm down a bit."
1045019136069,DIALOGUESCENE117_ASTRID_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>I AM CALM!
1045019136070,DIALOGUESCENE117_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Geez! That was convincing.
1045019136071,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,...
1045019136072,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,"...I've been looking for that person for so long, and finally, I found him. 
I can at last let him pay for everything he has done."
1045019136073,DIALOGUESCENE118_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Who is that unfortunate person, who has you on their bad side?"
1045019136074,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,...His name is Andrey. He was...a former adventurer at the Guild.
1045019136075,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE5,He was a member of my former party...
1045019136076,DIALOGUESCENE118_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"<?shakeScreen>Wait...What?
If so, why do you want to see him dead?"
1045019136077,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>Because he betrayed us! He was part of the cultists who infiltrated the Guild!
He was never one of us!"
1045019136078,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE8,"So many people died in the Guild because of him!
He has to pay for it and I want to do it personally!"
1045019136079,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE9,"Even right now, he is causing harm to people. I've heard that he and some other cultists are using hobgoblins to abduct people."
1045019136080,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE10,We need to get there and put an end to it!
1045019136081,DIALOGUESCENE118_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"I guess we should...
Fine! I'll assemble a party and tell you when we're ready."
1045019136082,DIALOGUESCENE118_ASTRID_DIALOGUE12,Good!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045019136083,DIALOGUESCENE118_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,(That was intense.)
1045019136084,DIALOGUESCENE118_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,"<?whiteFlash>Hello, Falken. Didn't see you there."
1045019136085,DIALOGUESCENE118_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15,"Hello, Guildmaster. I... just heard your conversation with Astrid.
Could I ask you something, Guild Master?"
1045019136086,DIALOGUESCENE118_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,What is it?
1045019136087,DIALOGUESCENE118_FALKEN_DIALOGUE17,<?whiteFlash>I'd prefer if you send those adventurers without telling Astrid.
1045019136088,DIALOGUESCENE118_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"Are you worried about her? Sure, I haven't seen her in combat before, so I'm not sure she's still able to go on the field but..."
1045019136089,DIALOGUESCENE118_FALKEN_DIALOGUE19,"No, no. That's not what I'm worried about. 
It's about Andrey."
1045019136090,DIALOGUESCENE118_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,The one Astrid seems to have a huge bone to pick with? Did you know him?
1045019136091,DIALOGUESCENE118_FALKEN_DIALOGUE21,...I did. And Astrid wasn't entirely honest with you. Andrey wasn't simply a former party member of hers...
1045019136092,DIALOGUESCENE119_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,He was her former lover.
1045019136093,DIALOGUESCENE119_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>WHAT?!
1045019136094,DIALOGUESCENE119_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"...And it wasn't just a fling or anything non-committal. She was really in love. 
Anyone could have seen it."
1045019136095,DIALOGUESCENE119_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"(I certainly have a hard time imagining her go all lovey-dovey. Ugh..., this brings back some horrible memories with Franny and Fiola.)"
1045019136096,DIALOGUESCENE119_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,"However, since Andrey's betrayal, she has never been the same again. She has completely shut herself off from anybody. Recently I had hoped that she might have gotten past it, but now that Andrey has reappeared..."
1045019136097,DIALOGUESCENE119_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,I fear if she's the one who kills him... then she would never recover from it.
1045019136098,DIALOGUESCENE119_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>So, please, Guild Master. I'm actually begging you here!
Please, don't let Astrid make that mistake!"
1045019136099,DIALOGUESCENE119_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"...I'm not sure about it... but I trust your judgment. 
I'll send the adventurers and won't tell Astrid."
1045019136100,DIALOGUESCENE119_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,"Thank you, Guild Master. 
Trust me...It's for the best."
1045019136101,DIALOGUESCENE120_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,"So the adventurers did it, huh."
1045019136102,DIALOGUESCENE120_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Yeah...
1045019136103,DIALOGUESCENE120_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,...How did Astrid react?
1045019136104,DIALOGUESCENE120_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Don't know. I left a message for her saying it was your idea.
1045019136105,DIALOGUESCENE120_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,You what now?
1045019136106,DIALOGUESCENE121_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>(Speaking of the devil.)
1045019136107,DIALOGUESCENE121_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,Everyone besides Falken...out!
1045019136108,DIALOGUESCENE121_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,"Hey, wait a second! You can't just throw everyone out!
Especially me!"

1045019136110,DIALOGUESCENE121_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Ieeps!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045019136111,DIALOGUESCENE121_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"...Good luck, Falken."
1045019136112,DIALOGUESCENE121_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"Hey wait! You're not just going to leave me, are you?"
1045019136113,DIALOGUESCENE122_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,"Well, Falken is a goner.
Maybe she'll leave him with a broken arm."
1045019136114,DIALOGUESCENE122_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Don't be ridiculous. She wouldn't break his arms.
1045019136115,DIALOGUESCENE122_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,Are you sure about that?
1045019136116,DIALOGUESCENE122_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...Let's watch through one of the windows and make sure nothing happens.
1045019136117,DIALOGUESCENE123_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,...Explain yourself.
1045019136118,DIALOGUESCENE123_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,...I did what I had to do.
1045019136119,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Who are you to decide that?!
1045019136120,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>Andrey was my responsibility! Mine!
<?shakeScreen>You denied me my chance to make things right!"
1045019136121,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,...None of it was your fault!
1045019136122,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,"<?shakeScreen>But it was!
..."
1045019136123,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE5,...I knew he was a cultist!
1045019136124,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045019136125,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE7,...Before the night of the Attack...he talked with me about the cultists. How they might not be what they seem.
1045019136126,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE8,"...It was obvious that he wanted to see if he could recruit me...It was obvious that he was one of them...
...But I willfully ignored it...because I wanted to believe in him."
1045019136127,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE9,I could have saved everyone. But my mistake was trusting someone close to me when I should have known better.
1045019136128,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,"...
Even knowing that, I would have still not let you kill him."
1045019136129,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE11,<?shakeScreen>Why you...!
1045019136130,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,"<?whiteFlash>Because you really loved him.
And I know he loved you too."
1045019136131,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE13,...
1045019136132,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,"Remember when you told me that you lost your eye because you tried to stop Andrey that night? You both armed with your bows aiming at each other.
You said you both barely missed each other."
1045019136133,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15,...I never bought that story. You two have never missed your mark before.
1045019136134,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE16,You just both couldn't do it.
1045019136135,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE17,"That's why I believe that if you had done it this time, then it would have haunted you for the rest of your life."
1045019136136,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE18,And I couldn't let that happen.
1045019136137,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE19,...Why do you care so much?
1045019136138,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE20,"...You know why.
It's obvious, isn't it?"
1045019136139,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE21,...
1045019136140,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE22,"I'm sorry, Falken. I don't think I can ever trust someone like that again."
1045019136141,DIALOGUESCENE124_ASTRID_DIALOGUE23,You deserve better.<?fadeOutNPC>
1045019136142,DIALOGUESCENE124_FALKEN_DIALOGUE24,...*sighs*...
1045019136143,DIALOGUESCENE125_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,What just happened?
1045019136144,DIALOGUESCENE125_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,I think Falken just got dumped.
1045019136145,DIALOGUESCENE126_ALISSA_DIALOGUE1,...a-and then we got attacked...they just started to kill everybody!
1045019136146,DIALOGUESCENE126_ALISSA_DIALOGUE2,We...tried to run away.*Sob*....I ran...I ran with all my might. 
1045019136147,DIALOGUESCENE126_ALISSA_DIALOGUE3,I heard my family screaming *sob*...but I was too afraid to look back. 
1045019136148,DIALOGUESCENE126_ALISSA_DIALOGUE4,A-and when I finally stopped....I was the only one left.
1045019136149,DIALOGUESCENE126_ALISSA_DIALOGUE5,Oh gods....*sob*. They're all dead!
1045019136150,DIALOGUESCENE126_ALISSA_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreenWeak>*WAAAAHHHHH*
1045019136151,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,Could you bring her to one of the guest rooms? I think she needs some rest...and some time to grieve.
1045019136152,DIALOGUESCENE126_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE8,O-of course...<?fadeOutNPC>
1045019136153,DIALOGUESCENE126_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Did something happen?
1045019136154,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE10,"Oh Guild Master...you saw that, didn't you?"
1045019136155,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE11,Some adventurers found the poor girl completely battered and bruised outside the guild. Lying half dead on the ground.
1045019136156,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE12,She told us that she is the daughter of a merchant and that she and her family were part of a caravan that tragically got attacked by bandits.
1045019136157,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE13,She managed to flee but...the rest of her family wasn't so lucky.
1045019136158,DIALOGUESCENE126_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,That is quite...tragic.  
1045019136159,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE15,...
1045019136160,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE16,...Lately we get more and more stories about bandits attacking people. It's like there are no safe roads anymore.
1045019136161,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE17,Even more disturbing is the fact that they also started abducting people. The strange thing is that they never asked for a ransom and nobody knows what happened to them.
1045019136162,DIALOGUESCENE126_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,That's rather...worrisome. I wonder if this is going to have an impact on us.
1045019136163,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE19,...
1045023330304,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE20,...I hate to ask...but what do we do about the girl from before? I don't think she has anywhere else to go now.
1045023330305,DIALOGUESCENE126_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,...I'll talk with Eden later. Maybe the church of Ghanenta will take her in and take care of her.
1045023330306,DIALOGUESCENE126_TAVI_DIALOGUE22,"Thank you, Guild Master. I hope life will treat her kinder from now on."
1045023330307,DIALOGUESCENE126_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,...Let's hope so...
1045023330308,DIALOGUESCENE127_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE1,"So, you're the ones from that Adventurer Guild that keeps getting in our ways."
1045023330309,DIALOGUESCENE127_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE2,But that will end today!
1045023330310,DIALOGUESCENE127_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE3,First I will kill you! Then I will kill that snot-nosed noble and his men.
1045023330311,DIALOGUESCENE127_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE4,And then I will come for your Guild!
1045023330312,DIALOGUESCENE128_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE1,"So, you're the ones from that Adventurer Guild that keeps getting in our ways."
1045023330313,DIALOGUESCENE128_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE2,But that will end today!
1045023330314,DIALOGUESCENE128_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE3,First I will kill you! Then I will kill that snot-nosed noble and his men.
1045023330315,DIALOGUESCENE128_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE4,And then I will come for your Guild!
1045023330316,DIALOGUESCENE128_ALISSA_DIALOGUE5,You will die before that happens and pay for everything you've taken from me!
1045023330317,DIALOGUESCENE128_BANDIT KING_DIALOGUE6,I don't even know who you are.
1045023330318,DIALOGUESCENE129_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>Finally, I found you!"
1045023330319,DIALOGUESCENE129_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,And the nightmare begins.
1045023330320,DIALOGUESCENE129_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>Just quit your needless quips and come with me!
1045023330321,DIALOGUESCENE129_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,We have an important guest!
1045023330322,DIALOGUESCENE129_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(An important guest?...)
1045023330323,DIALOGUESCENE130_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,Hmpf! Finally! 
1045023330324,DIALOGUESCENE130_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,You should be ashamed for making us wait so long.
1045023330325,DIALOGUESCENE130_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(Not her again...)
1045023330326,DIALOGUESCENE130_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,(Behave this time!)
1045023330327,DIALOGUESCENE130_GILBERT_DIALOGUE5,"Now, now, Cecil! We were the ones who came unannounced."
1045023330328,DIALOGUESCENE130_GILBERT_DIALOGUE6,And for that I'm truly sorry.
1045023330329,DIALOGUESCENE130_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,(I guess this is her older brother.)
1045023330330,DIALOGUESCENE130_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,(Seems like a decent guy. I was already worried he'd be more like the kid.)
1045023330331,DIALOGUESCENE130_CECILIA_DIALOGUE9,"<?shakeScreen>You just thought of something rude, didn't you?"
1045023330332,DIALOGUESCENE130_GILBERT_DIALOGUE10,"I think introductions are in order.
My name is Gilbert Greyhorn. I'm the man your adventurers have recently saved."
1045023330333,DIALOGUESCENE130_GILBERT_DIALOGUE11,"I know that my gratitude might come late at this point, but I still wanted to thank the Adventurer Guild for what they have done for me."
1045023330334,DIALOGUESCENE130_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,Of course that's not worth mentioning! We are always happy to help a noble house like the Greyhorns.
1045023330335,DIALOGUESCENE130_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"Well, I wouldn't say..."
1045023330336,DIALOGUESCENE130_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,<?whiteFlash>(HNNNNGGGH!!!)
1045023330337,DIALOGUESCENE130_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,(SHE'S STEPPING ON MY FOOT!)
1045023330338,DIALOGUESCENE130_FIOLA_DIALOGUE16,And we'd also be happy if we can do anything else for you in the future.
1045023330339,DIALOGUESCENE131_GILBERT_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>...That is actually another reason why I'm here. 
1045023330340,DIALOGUESCENE131_GILBERT_DIALOGUE2,I want to task the Adventurer Guild with a Quest.
1045023330341,DIALOGUESCENE131_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"(From experience, working for nobles pays a lot.
<waitfor=0.5> Unfortunately it's usually also that much more dangerous.)"
1045023330342,DIALOGUESCENE131_GILBERT_DIALOGUE4,As you know our last attempt to bring down the bandit king has failed. Since then a lot more villages and towns have been raided and people have been abducted.
1045023330343,DIALOGUESCENE131_GILBERT_DIALOGUE5,It's a situation which we can not allow to continue any longer.
1045023330344,DIALOGUESCENE131_GILBERT_DIALOGUE6,The last few days my family has been consolidating our forces for a second attack on the bandit king.
1045023330345,DIALOGUESCENE131_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Aren't you afraid it will end like last time?
1045023330346,DIALOGUESCENE132_GILBERT_DIALOGUE1,"No, because it will be different from last time."
1045023330347,DIALOGUESCENE132_GILBERT_DIALOGUE2,This time I want your adventurers to join us in battle.
1045023330348,DIALOGUESCENE132_GILBERT_DIALOGUE3,I've seen your adventurers fight. They're stronger than any of my men.
1045023330349,DIALOGUESCENE132_GILBERT_DIALOGUE4,"I'm convinced that with your adventurers on our side, we can finally put an end to the bandit king!"
1045023330350,DIALOGUESCENE133_GILBERT_DIALOGUE1,"What do you say, Guild Master?"
1045023330351,DIALOGUESCENE133_GILBERT_DIALOGUE2,Will the Adventurer Guild lend us their strength?
1045023330352,DIALOGUESCENE134_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>The Adventurer Guild accepts the Quest.
1045023330353,DIALOGUESCENE135_GILBERT_DIALOGUE1,"Thank you, Guild Master! 
I swear that I will not forget this favor."
1045023330354,DIALOGUESCENE135_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,You should feel honored to have a noble house like ours acknowledge the value of the Adventurer Guild.
1045023330355,DIALOGUESCENE135_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...
1045023330356,DIALOGUESCENE136_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Why are you even here? This is a talk for grown-ups.
1045023330357,DIALOGUESCENE136_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>T-the audacity! 
1045023330358,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE3,I'm sorry Guild Master but lately Cecil has refused to leave my side ever since I came back. It's like she's afraid I will disappear when she loses sight of me.
1045023330359,DIALOGUESCENE136_CECILIA_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>BROTHER!!!
1045023330360,DIALOGUESCENE136_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,That's...surprisingly adorable.
1045023330361,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE6,Isn't it? My little sister is the most adorable being out there!
1045023330362,DIALOGUESCENE136_CECILIA_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>BROTHER!
1045023330363,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE8,"Did you know when I returned, she ran towards me crying? She tried to hug me but because she's so small she just hugged my leg.
"
1045023330364,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE9,"It took a lot of effort to pry her away from my leg, so tightly did she cling to me."
1045023330365,DIALOGUESCENE136_CECILIA_DIALOGUE10,Stop it!<?shakeScreenWeak><waitfor=0.5> No more!<?shakeScreenWeak>
1045023330366,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE11,And she tried to tell me that she was worried but I could hardly understand anything from all the tears and snot on her face. 
1045023330367,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE12,"Honestly, I felt like her cuteness that day would kill me after the bandits failed to."
1045023330368,DIALOGUESCENE136_CECILIA_DIALOGUE13,"<?whiteFlash><?shakeScreen><speed=3>I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH, STUPID BROTHER!"
1045023330369,DIALOGUESCENE136_CECILIA_DIALOGUE14,WAAAAAHHHH!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045023330370,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE15,...I might have overdone it on my teasing.
1045023330371,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE16,Let us talk about the details of the attack later. We'll be in the tavern if you need us.
1045023330372,DIALOGUESCENE136_GILBERT_DIALOGUE17,<?shakeScreen>Cecil! <?shakeScreen>Come back! Your big brother is sorryyyyyy.....!!!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045023330373,DIALOGUESCENE136_FIOLA_DIALOGUE18,...
1045023330374,DIALOGUESCENE136_FIOLA_DIALOGUE19,I so want to hug her.
1045023330375,DIALOGUESCENE136_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,<?whiteFlash>W-what was that?
1045023330376,DIALOGUESCENE136_FIOLA_DIALOGUE21,N-nothing! I said nothing!
1045023330377,DIALOGUESCENE137_MISASA_DIALOGUE1,N-North of here is a hall where the b-bandit king usually met with his inner circle. 
1045023330378,DIALOGUESCENE137_MISASA_DIALOGUE2,"I-if he's still here, t-then he might be there."
1045023330379,DIALOGUESCENE137_MISASA_DIALOGUE3,I-In the east is also a room where the p-prisoners are.
1045023330380,DIALOGUESCENE137_MISASA_DIALOGUE4,A-and south of them is the t-treasury room.
1045023330381,DIALOGUESCENE138_SOLDIER_DIALOGUE1,Careful adventurers!
1045023330382,DIALOGUESCENE138_SOLDIER_DIALOGUE2,There are bandits patrolling on the path ahead.
1045023330383,DIALOGUESCENE138_SOLDIER_DIALOGUE3,We should try to avoid fights. Otherwise we might get swarmed by enemies.
1045023330384,DIALOGUESCENE139_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,Damn! There are even more bandits ahead and they're blocking the road.
1045023330385,DIALOGUESCENE139_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE2,Does that mean we have to fight our way through?
1045023330386,DIALOGUESCENE139_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...<waitfor=0.8><?whiteFlash>Not necessarily.
1045023330387,DIALOGUESCENE139_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Not everything has to end in a fight. We might have other options, depending on the situation."
1045023330388,DIALOGUESCENE139_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Let's see what we can do.
1045023330389,DIALOGUESCENE140_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"...and with that concludes the tale of ""The Maiden's woes""."
1045023330390,DIALOGUESCENE140_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE2,Tell us another story!
1045023330391,DIALOGUESCENE140_VINCENT _DIALOGUE3,Far be it from me to deny a beautiful woman's request.
1045023330392,DIALOGUESCENE140_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,But alas! Any more strain to my voice will only rob the world of its beautiful sound.
1045023330393,DIALOGUESCENE140_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,Kyaaaahhh!!
1045023330394,DIALOGUESCENE141_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...What am I looking at?
1045023330395,DIALOGUESCENE141_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,"Oh, hello Guild Master!"
1045023330396,DIALOGUESCENE141_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,You just arrived in time to see the female adventurers fawning over the new arrival.
1045023330397,DIALOGUESCENE141_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,I have to admit that he got a beautiful voice and some funny stories.
1045023330398,DIALOGUESCENE141_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Funny stories? Like what?
1045023330399,DIALOGUESCENE141_TAVI_DIALOGUE6,"Like the last one, you just missed."
1045023330400,DIALOGUESCENE141_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,A love triangle that ends in a bloody feud between two families.
1045023330401,DIALOGUESCENE141_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...
1045023330402,DIALOGUESCENE141_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,(I don't think that was supposed to be funny.)
1045023330403,DIALOGUESCENE141_VINCENT _DIALOGUE10,Salutations!
1045023330404,DIALOGUESCENE141_VINCENT _DIALOGUE11,My deepest apologies if I'm disturbing you but I have to ask!
1045023330405,DIALOGUESCENE141_VINCENT _DIALOGUE12,Are you by chance the Guild Master of this place?
1045023330406,DIALOGUESCENE141_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,...Yeah?
1045023330407,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"Marvelous! I knew right from the beginning, when I laid my eyes on you that there was something different about you!"
1045023330408,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,"A majestic aura, fitting for the leader of the bands of heroes here!"
1045023330409,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"(This is going to be very tiresome, isn't it?)"
1045023330410,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,"Let me introduce myself:  My name is Vincent Accusto. An entertainer and seeker of stories. I come bearing the gifts of laughter and tears, of love and heartbreak, of triumph and tragedy."
1045023330411,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE5,May I be so blessed to learn your beautiful name?
1045023330412,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...I'm {PROTAGONIST}.
1045023330413,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE7,...{PROTAGONIST}...was it?
1045023330414,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"Yes, that's right."
1045023330415,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE9,...You have some other name you go by?
1045023330416,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,No.
1045023330417,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE11,...

1045023330419,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreen>That name lacks any sense of grandeur! You have to change it!
1045023330420,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE14,"<?shakeScreen>You're the new leader of the Adventurer Guild, for crying out loud!"
1045023330421,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE15,How would any story about the Adventurer Guild sound when its' leader has such a lame name!
1045023330422,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE16,The audience would leave as soon as they heard the name!
1045023330423,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,And why would that matter to you?
1045023330424,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE18,Of course it matters! Because I want to be part of the Adventurer Guild! 
1045023330425,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,...You want to be part of the Adventurer Guild?
1045023330426,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE20,"Yes, I do, dear Guild Master!"
1045023330427,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE21,"Not as an adventurer, mind you."
1045023330428,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE22,These hands are far too precious to risk them getting injured.
1045023330429,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE23,But I'd like to stay here and follow the Guild's progress.
1045023330430,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE24,I'm certain that the Adventurer Guild will accomplish great feats in the future.
1045023330431,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE25,Feats I want to immortalize in songs and stories. 
1045023330432,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE26,And what can you offer in return?
1045023330433,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE27,Music and song for the weary adventurers and maybe even private lessons for those who wish to learn my craft.
1045023330434,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE28,Not sure if being able to play the lute would be any use to adventurers.
1045023330435,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE29,"Do not underestimate the value of good entertainment my dear Guild Master.
For tedium is just as deadly as any blade on a long road."
1045023330436,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE30,...Fine. You can stay. 
1045023330437,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE31,"Thank you, Guild Master! I will make sure to spread the name and fame of the Adventurer Guild!"
1045023330438,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE32,...
1045023330439,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE33,Now back to your name. I could make you a list of splendid names that would fit you far better.
1045023330440,DIALOGUESCENE142_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE34,"Okay, that's it! I'm out of here!"
1045023330441,DIALOGUESCENE142_VINCENT _DIALOGUE35,<?shakeScreen>W-wait! Guild Master! We have to discuss this! It's important!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045023330442,DIALOGUESCENE142_TAVI_DIALOGUE36,...
1045023330443,DIALOGUESCENE142_TAVI_DIALOGUE37,...wait a second...
1045023330444,DIALOGUESCENE142_TAVI_DIALOGUE38,...did that bard pay for his drinks?
1045023330445,DIALOGUESCENE142_TAVI_DIALOGUE39,<?shakeScreen>Hey! You! Come back here!<?fadeOutNPC>

1045027524635,DIALOGUESCENE147_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,...Hello Guild Master.
1045027524636,DIALOGUESCENE147_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I was kinda surprised to hear you wanted to talk to me.
1045027524637,DIALOGUESCENE147_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Usually, you're not that proactive when it comes to conversations."
1045027524638,DIALOGUESCENE147_BARRET_DIALOGUE5,...
1045027524639,DIALOGUESCENE147_BARRET_DIALOGUE6,"...I need to ask something of you, Guild Master."
1045027524640,DIALOGUESCENE147_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,What is it?
1045027524641,DIALOGUESCENE147_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,...I want to request the help of the Adventurer Guild to find somebody.
1045027524642,DIALOGUESCENE147_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Is it someone who owes you money? Do you want us to break some fingers?
1045027524643,DIALOGUESCENE147_BARRET_DIALOGUE10,No...
1045027524644,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,I want you to kill him.
1045027524645,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045027524646,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...Are you joking? I can never tell if you're joking. I mean I was joking but...
1045027524647,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,...I am not.
1045027524648,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045027524649,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...Who is the target?
1045027524650,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE7,He's a man now known as the Road Slasher...
1045027524651,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,The Road Slasher? I think I sometimes hear the name drop amongst travelers. Not in a good way...
1045027524652,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE9,No...very likely not. 
1045027524653,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE10,The last several years he has made the roads of the kingdom unsafe for lone travelers.
1045027524654,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE11,"For years he has indiscriminately killed people on the roads and has evaded all guards and adventurers, who were coming for him."
1045027524655,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,I see. He certainly sounds like someone who we would be tasked to deal with eventually.
1045027524656,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,But I'm still surprised that the quest would come from you. I never thought of you as someone who wants somebody dead.
1045027524657,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Did he do anything to you?
1045027524658,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE15,...No...
1045027524659,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE16,...It's the weapon he wields...
1045027524660,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE17,<?whiteFlash>I crafted it...
1045027524661,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,I see...
1045027524662,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE19,Please Guild Master...I do not want any more people to fall victim to him.
1045027524663,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,"Do not worry, Barret. "
1045027524664,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,The Guild accepts your Quest.
1045027524665,DIALOGUESCENE148_BARRET_DIALOGUE22,"Thank you, Guild Master."
1045027524666,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,(It probably won't be easy to catch the Road Slasher. He'll probably avoid any large groups of adventurers.)
1045027524667,DIALOGUESCENE148_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,(I'll probably only be able to send one adventurer if we want to catch him.)
1045027524668,DIALOGUESCENE149_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,"Bandits, huh?"
1045027524669,DIALOGUESCENE149_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,Usually crude weapons. Heavy armors should suffice.
1045027524670,DIALOGUESCENE149_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"I see...anything else, you'd like to say?"
1045027524671,DIALOGUESCENE149_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,No.
1045027524672,DIALOGUESCENE149_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(I just can't read this guy.)
1045027524673,DIALOGUESCENE150_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,...I see.
1045027524674,DIALOGUESCENE150_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...
1045027524675,DIALOGUESCENE150_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...You wouldn't have a Bandit King Slayer around, would you?"
1045027524676,DIALOGUESCENE150_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,...No.
1045027524677,DIALOGUESCENE150_BARRET_DIALOGUE5,"...I could craft a sword and call it ""Bandit King Slayer"", if you need me to."
1045027524678,DIALOGUESCENE150_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(...Is he also joking? I can't tell if he's joking.)
1045027524679,DIALOGUESCENE151_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,"...I see. So, she is coming back."
1045027524680,DIALOGUESCENE151_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What do you think?
1045027524681,DIALOGUESCENE151_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,...I do not know.
1045027524682,DIALOGUESCENE151_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,I hope that she does not bring more misfortune to the Guild.
1045027524683,DIALOGUESCENE152_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Were you there on the night when the ""attack"" happened?"
1045027524684,DIALOGUESCENE152_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,...I was.
1045027524685,DIALOGUESCENE152_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,I still remember the night.
1045027524686,DIALOGUESCENE152_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,A scream woke me up and I saw adventurers fighting each other with my weapons...
1045027524687,DIALOGUESCENE152_BARRET_DIALOGUE5,Confused I ran outside trying to stop them. I grabbed them and tried to pull them away from each other.
1045027524688,DIALOGUESCENE152_BARRET_DIALOGUE6,But someone struck me from behind and I lost consciousness.
1045027524689,DIALOGUESCENE152_BARRET_DIALOGUE7,When I woke up it was already all over.
1045027524690,DIALOGUESCENE152_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,I was lucky to survive that day. Many others weren't.
1045027524691,DIALOGUESCENE152_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...
1045027524692,DIALOGUESCENE153_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,...What are you going to do with her?
1045027524693,DIALOGUESCENE153_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,I don't know. For now she'll just stay in the dungeon until we know what to do with her.
1045027524694,DIALOGUESCENE153_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,...Be careful Guild Master.
1045027524695,DIALOGUESCENE153_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,Do not do anything you might regret.
1045027524696,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,...I've heard the Road Slasher is no more...
1045027524697,DIALOGUESCENE154_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Yes.
1045027524698,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,...And his weapon?...
1045027524699,DIALOGUESCENE154_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,They brought it back with them.
1045027524700,DIALOGUESCENE154_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Here.
I thought you'd might like it back."
1045027524701,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE6,"Thank you, Guild Master."
1045027524702,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE7,...
1045027524703,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,"...Seeing this blade, I wonder how many lives it has taken."
1045027524704,DIALOGUESCENE154_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"You know none of them were your fault, right?"
1045027524705,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE10,...I wonder about that.
1045027524706,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE11,In my lifetime I have crafted so many weapons and sold them without any regard to their purpose.
1045027524707,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE12,I find it hard to believe that I bear no responsibility for the harm they caused.
1045027524708,DIALOGUESCENE154_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,...
1045027524709,DIALOGUESCENE154_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,If it bothers you that much...
1045027524710,DIALOGUESCENE154_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,<?whiteFlash>...how about we reforge the weapon and give it to one of the adventurers?
1045027524711,DIALOGUESCENE154_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,Who knows? Maybe it becomes a weapon that in the end will save more lives than the Road Slasher has ever taken.
1045027524712,DIALOGUESCENE154_BARRET_DIALOGUE17,...
1045027524713,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,...You two are really similar...
1045027524714,DIALOGUESCENE155_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What do you mean?
1045027524715,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,You and the former Guild Master.
1045027524716,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,...I actually didn't want to join the Adventurer Guild.
1045027524717,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE5,I never wanted to craft weapons again. I already had put enough on my conscience.
1045027524718,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE6,That's when he told me...
1045027524719,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE7,"<?whiteFlash>""If your past work bothers you that much, then let me help you create weapons that will save more lives than they could have ever taken!"""
1045027524720,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,...
1045027524721,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>I'll do it! I will make a new weapon out of this.
1045027524722,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE10,I'll do it because I trust the Adventurer Guild!
1045027524723,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE11,"I'll do it because I trust you, Guild Master!"
1045027524724,DIALOGUESCENE155_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"Thank you, Barret."
1045027524725,DIALOGUESCENE155_BARRET_DIALOGUE13,"...I should be saying that, Guild Master."
1045027524726,DIALOGUESCENE156_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, for how long have you been with the Guild now, Barret?"
1045027524727,DIALOGUESCENE156_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,Nearly ten years.
1045027524728,DIALOGUESCENE156_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,And how did you end up in the Guild?
1045027524729,DIALOGUESCENE156_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,Been a Blacksmith in the city. Fran saw my work.
1045027524730,DIALOGUESCENE156_BARRET_DIALOGUE5,Asked me to become the blacksmith here.
1045027524731,DIALOGUESCENE156_BARRET_DIALOGUE6,I accepted.
1045027524732,DIALOGUESCENE156_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"(Short and sweet, huh?)"
1045027524733,DIALOGUESCENE157_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,"Hello, Guild Master."
1045027524734,DIALOGUESCENE158_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,I will get back to work then.
1045027524735,DIALOGUESCENE159_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,...
1045027524736,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Barret? Are you here? We want to introduce you to somebody.
1045027524737,DIALOGUESCENE160_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,...
1045027524738,DIALOGUESCENE160_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,I'm here.
1045027524739,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"<?shakeScreen>Yikes! Easy, big guy!"
1045027524740,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,Didn't I tell you not to sneak up on people like that?
1045027524741,DIALOGUESCENE160_BARRET_DIALOGUE6,...I wasn't. I stood here when you came in.
1045027524742,DIALOGUESCENE160_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,Hello Barret.
1045027524743,DIALOGUESCENE160_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,Hello Fiola.
1045027524744,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,"Barret, this is the new Guild Master. How about you introduce yourself?"
1045027524745,DIALOGUESCENE160_BARRET_DIALOGUE10,...The name is Barret.
1045027524746,DIALOGUESCENE160_BARRET_DIALOGUE11,I'm the blacksmith.
1045027524747,DIALOGUESCENE160_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Nice to meet you. I'm {PROTAGONIST}.
1045027524748,DIALOGUESCENE160_BARRET_DIALOGUE13,...
1045027524749,DIALOGUESCENE160_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...
1045027524750,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15,"Barret isn't much of a talker, so you have to excuse him when he just goes silent."
1045027524751,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE16,"But he is an excellent blacksmith, who has been providing our adventurers with equipment for years now."
1045027524752,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE17,"Whenever we have enough materials, consider letting Barret craft new equipment for our adventurers."
1045027524753,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE18,It's the most effective way of boosting an adventurer's combat capabilities.
1045027524754,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE19,"Do you have anything to add, Barret?"
1045027524755,DIALOGUESCENE160_BARRET_DIALOGUE20,...No.
1045027524756,DIALOGUESCENE160_FALKEN_DIALOGUE21,"...You're the salt of the earth, Barret."
1045027524757,DIALOGUESCENE161_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Do you mind if I ask you how the Road Slasher is wielding one of your weapons?
1045027524758,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,...It was many years ago when I was still a city blacksmith.
1045027524759,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,I wasn't a weaponsmith nor did I ever intend to be one.
1045027524760,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,"When my father was still alive, he taught me to avoid the tools of war."
1045027524761,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE5,"However, things turned out differently when my wife...died during childbirth."
1045027524762,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE6,Just like that I was suddenly a single father with a newborn daughter to take care of.
1045027524763,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE7,We weren't well off and I was worried if I could take care of my daughter on my own.
1045027524764,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,"Suddenly, I felt like I was in need of money."
1045027524765,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE9,It was then when a war with the neighbouring kingdom was declared.
1045027524766,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE10,...And I decided to take advantage of that.
1045027524767,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE11,I started to also offer to forge weapons for soldiers.
1045027524768,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE12,In the beginning my weapons were crude but I was a fast learner. It didn't take long until my weapons were sought by many who wanted to join the war.
1045031718912,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE13,"However, it didn't bring me much joy to know that it meant that my weapons were effective in killing people."
1045031718913,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE14,"Nevertheless, it earned me more money than my usual work has ever done. I was able to afford a nanny for my daughter and could even send her to a school, when she got older."
1045031718914,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE15,Then one day <b>he</b> appeared before me.
1045031718915,DIALOGUESCENE161_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,You mean the Road Slasher.
1045031718916,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE17,"...If you had seen that boy at that time, you would have never thought that he would one day become an infamous killer."
1045031718917,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE18,"I remember a noble boy, hardly old enough to be called a young man, who came to me shaking with fear."
1045031718918,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE19,He wanted to join the war and asked me to forge him a weapon.
1045031718919,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE20,"However, to me he didn't look like someone who was eager to join a war, so I asked him for his reasons."
1045031718920,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE21,He told me that his family considered him a weakling and coward and by joining the war he wanted to prove them wrong.
1045031718921,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE22,I knew it was a bad idea...and yet..
1045031718922,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE23,...all my reservation were gone when he told me what he was willing to pay.
1045031718923,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE24,...It was enough that I would never have to forge another weapon again.
1045031718924,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE25,...I accepted.
1045031718925,DIALOGUESCENE161_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE26,...
1045031718926,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE27,...He brought to me a rare ore that was in in his family's posession for generations and I forged him a weapon that was the peak of all my creations.
1045031718927,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE28,A sharp blade gleaming with a pure shade of crimson.
1045031718928,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE29,And that's how the Road Slasher aquired his weapon.
1045031718929,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE30,I stopped forging weapons after that. I didn't want to have any part of the war anymore.
1045031718930,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE31,"However, during the war I sometimes heard rumors of a soldier with a crimson red blade who has made himself a bloody name on the battlefield."
1045031718931,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE32,After the war ended the boy never returned home. Instead rumors of a man killing innocent people on the road with a red blade started to spread.
1045031718932,DIALOGUESCENE161_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE33,...It could be anybody.
1045031718933,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE34,"No, I'm certain. It's the boy I've forged the weapon for."
1045031718934,DIALOGUESCENE161_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE35,"...You shouldn't blame yourself for that. If not you, another blacksmith would have forged a weapon for him."
1045031718935,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE36,...Maybe...
1045031718936,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE37,...But maybe... if I had stopped him that day...maybe he would have given up on joining the war. 
1045031718937,DIALOGUESCENE161_BARRET_DIALOGUE38,But I didn't.
1045031718938,DIALOGUESCENE162_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Don't you think you take the whole noble thing a bit far? I mean your brother doesn't seem to care.
1045031718939,DIALOGUESCENE162_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,"As much as I respect my brother, he sometimes forgets to behave in a manner befitting of his station. If we don't act dignified then it will only bring shame to the family."
1045031718940,DIALOGUESCENE162_CECILIA_DIALOGUE3,That's the duty of those who are born in a noble house.
1045031718941,DIALOGUESCENE162_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...Is that what you want or is that what your family wants?
1045031718942,DIALOGUESCENE162_CECILIA_DIALOGUE5,...
1045031718943,DIALOGUESCENE163_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Can you tell me something about your other siblings?
1045031718944,DIALOGUESCENE163_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,"I do have three more elder brothers, but I don't really know them that well."
1045031718945,DIALOGUESCENE163_CECILIA_DIALOGUE3,My brother Gilbert is the only one who ever visits me.
1045031718946,DIALOGUESCENE163_CECILIA_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>B-but I'm sure that's because they're too occupied with other stuff!
1045031718947,DIALOGUESCENE163_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(Probably stuff like who gets the biggest slice of the inheritance pie)
1045031718948,DIALOGUESCENE164_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,Your loss.
1045031718949,DIALOGUESCENE165_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,"Ah, I see you're here for my opinions."
1045031718950,DIALOGUESCENE166_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So why are you here again?
1045031718951,DIALOGUESCENE166_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,"Why wouldn't I? After all, I'm also part of the Greyhorn Household, am I not? So if there are matters to be talked about that relates to my family, it's only right for me to also be there."
1045031718952,DIALOGUESCENE166_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,<?whiteFlash>Are you sure you don't just want to stay close to your big brother?
1045031718953,DIALOGUESCENE166_CECILIA_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>H-How insolent! Do you take me for a mere child?
1045031718954,DIALOGUESCENE166_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(...You are a child.)
1045031718955,DIALOGUESCENE166_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I was just under the impression that you really love your big brother.
1045031718956,DIALOGUESCENE166_CECILIA_DIALOGUE7,"While I'm certainly fond of my big brother, I assure you that it doesn't dictate my behaviour at all."
1045031718957,DIALOGUESCENE166_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...<?whiteFlash>Your brother just collapsed!
1045031718958,DIALOGUESCENE166_CECILIA_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>W-WHAT?!!!
1045031718959,DIALOGUESCENE166_GILBERT_DIALOGUE10,Is something wrong Cecil? You look a bit pale.
1045031718960,DIALOGUESCENE166_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,Whoops! I was wrong.
1045031718961,DIALOGUESCENE166_CECILIA_DIALOGUE12,<speed=2><?shakeScreen>YOU STINK! <?shakeScreen>YOU STINK !<?shakeScreen>YOU STINK!<?shakeScreen> YOU STINK!
1045031718962,DIALOGUESCENE166_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,(Now that's what a kid sounds like.)
1045031718963,DIALOGUESCENE167_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,Anything else you need my input on?
1045031718964,DIALOGUESCENE168_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>Here, you can have this back."
1045031718965,DIALOGUESCENE168_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,I-is that...?
1045031718966,DIALOGUESCENE168_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Yes, it's the ring you gave to us."
1045031718967,DIALOGUESCENE168_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I've decided that it's not really worth much and you might as well have it back.
1045031718968,DIALOGUESCENE168_CECILIA_DIALOGUE5,I...
1045031718969,DIALOGUESCENE168_CECILIA_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>No! I gave it to you as payment for your services. I can't just take it back.
1045031718970,DIALOGUESCENE168_CECILIA_DIALOGUE7,It would be unbecoming for a noble to not pay their debts.
1045031718971,DIALOGUESCENE168_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"But the ring is important to you, isn't it?"
1045031718972,DIALOGUESCENE168_CECILIA_DIALOGUE9,...
1045031718973,DIALOGUESCENE168_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,*sighs* Why are you making this so hard for me?
1045031718974,DIALOGUESCENE168_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"Then how about this? Instead of an old ring, I will have gained your favor."
1045031718975,DIALOGUESCENE168_CECILIA_DIALOGUE12,M-My favor?
1045031718976,DIALOGUESCENE168_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"You will become someone important and influential in the future, right? I'm sure that having the goodwill of someone like that is worth more than gold or any old ring."
1045031718977,DIALOGUESCENE168_CECILIA_DIALOGUE14,I guess that makes sense.
1045031718978,DIALOGUESCENE168_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,Good. Then take the ring now before you change your mind again.
1045031718979,DIALOGUESCENE168_CECILIA_DIALOGUE16,"...
Thank you, Guild Master."
1045031718980,DIALOGUESCENE168_GILBERT_DIALOGUE17,(I've overheard what you said and I'm thankful for what you've done. The ring is the only memento she has from the person who was like a mother to her.)
1045031718981,DIALOGUESCENE168_GILBERT_DIALOGUE18,(I will make sure that you will get recompensated.)
1045031718982,DIALOGUESCENE169_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So...we have a temple in the Adventurer Guild.
1045031718983,DIALOGUESCENE169_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Are you sure you want to step foot in here? Aren't you afraid of turning into ashes?
1045031718984,DIALOGUESCENE169_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,Of course not. Unlike you I'm not a faithless heathen. You should be more worried that the gods don't smite you because you defile this place with your presence.
1045031718985,DIALOGUESCENE169_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,I would pray for your soul...if you had one.
1045031718986,DIALOGUESCENE169_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,...You two should be more worried whether the gods would be offended by your bickerings in this place of all places.
1045031718987,DIALOGUESCENE169_NORA_DIALOGUE6,...
1045031718988,DIALOGUESCENE169_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"Oh, hey Nora. Nice to see you!"
1045031718989,DIALOGUESCENE169_NORA_DIALOGUE8,"Nice to see you too, Mr. Falken. And of course you too Mrs Fiola."
1045031718990,DIALOGUESCENE169_NORA_DIALOGUE9,If you'll excuse me I have something to do.<?fadeOutNPC>
1045031718991,DIALOGUESCENE169_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,(She left rather quickly...)
1045031718992,DIALOGUESCENE170_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,Hello Fiola! Hello Falken!
1045031718993,DIALOGUESCENE170_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,Hello Eden. We were actually looking for you.
1045031718994,DIALOGUESCENE170_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"Oh, is that so? Then I'm happy to be here. How can I help?"
1045031718995,DIALOGUESCENE170_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,We wanted to introduce you to the new Guild Master.
1045031718996,DIALOGUESCENE170_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,"Guild Master, this is Eden! He is in charge of the temple here and is also a training instructor for the Guild. Eden, this is our new Guild Master, {PROTAGONIST}."
1045031718997,DIALOGUESCENE171_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>...Oh!<waitfor=1>
So you're {PROTAGONIST}..."
1045031718998,DIALOGUESCENE171_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Is something wrong?
1045031718999,DIALOGUESCENE171_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"No..it's nothing.
...It's just I heard a lot about you."
1045031719000,DIALOGUESCENE171_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,*Sigh*. What did Fran tell you?
1045031719001,DIALOGUESCENE171_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,...It wasn't the former Guild Master...
1045031719002,DIALOGUESCENE172_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,...it was Fiola.
1045031719003,DIALOGUESCENE172_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,Why are you looking at me?
1045031719004,DIALOGUESCENE172_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,Isn't it obvious that you'd consult a priest if the devil haunts your nightmares?
1045031719005,DIALOGUESCENE172_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,Don't worry Guild Master. Of course I know Fiola was probably exaggerating. You seem to be a very touchy subject for her.
1045031719006,DIALOGUESCENE172_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I don't even want to know.
1045031719007,DIALOGUESCENE172_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,You really don't...
1045031719008,DIALOGUESCENE173_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,"*Cough*, *cough*! Moving on..."
1045031719009,DIALOGUESCENE173_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"As we told you before, sometimes adventurers will need to be sent out again before they're ready. In those cases Eden can help us."
1045031719010,DIALOGUESCENE173_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"Usually, healing magic is only capable of giving temporary relief. When adventurers use healing magic or healing potions on the field, they will still need to recover naturally when they come back."
1045031719011,DIALOGUESCENE173_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,But we priests from the Church Ghanenta are specialized in the art of healing and are capable of a ritual that can forcefully recover all injuries.
1045031719012,DIALOGUESCENE173_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"I'm familiar with that process.
It's not a great feeling."
1045031719013,DIALOGUESCENE173_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,"Unfortunately, it isn't. Having the body mend itself, is a rather painful process.
Therefore, it shouldn't be used too often."
1045031719014,DIALOGUESCENE173_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"Otherwise, your adventurers will be less than thankful."
1045031719015,DIALOGUESCENE174_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Wait!
1045031719016,DIALOGUESCENE174_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?triggerEvent=TUTORIAL_RESSOURCE_SHOW>This place here is full of resources we can collect. 
1045031719017,DIALOGUESCENE174_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Collecting resources is an important part of adventuring. We can use them to make our own potions and equipment.
1045031719018,DIALOGUESCENE174_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,So try to always collect all the resources if possible.
1045031719019,DIALOGUESCENE174_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Sometimes, you might not have enough space in your inventories, so try to prioritize what to bring back with you."
1045031719020,DIALOGUESCENE175_MISASA_DIALOGUE1,N-North of here is the room where those strange people in robes gather.
1045031719021,DIALOGUESCENE175_MISASA_DIALOGUE2,I-I never set foot in there but...w-whenever a prisoner is brought to them....they'll never retun.
1045031719022,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE1,...
1045031719023,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE2,Are you the Guild Master?
1045031719024,DIALOGUESCENE176_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,That I am.
1045031719025,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE4,...
1045031719026,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE5,...I think I want to join the Guild.
1045031719027,DIALOGUESCENE176_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,You think?
1045031719028,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE7,I guess I'm still on the fence on that decision.
1045031719029,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE8,I'm used to working alone. 
1045031719030,DIALOGUESCENE176_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,That's rather unusual. 
1045031719031,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE10,It's more reliable.
1045031719032,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE11,Other adventurers are usually...hard to trust.
1045031719033,DIALOGUESCENE176_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,(Can't really argue with that.)
1045031719034,DIALOGUESCENE176_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,What changed your mind?
1045031719035,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE14,...
1045031719036,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE15,Your adventurers managed to save a village I wanted to abandon.
1045031719037,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE16,Since then I wondered if there are more adventurers like that in the Adventurers Guild. 
1045031719038,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE17,I wondered if it's okay to trust them.
1045031719039,DIALOGUESCENE176_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,But you're not sure.
1045031719040,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE19,...How about you make that decision for me?
1045031719041,DIALOGUESCENE176_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,I really don't feel like I should be making such a life-altering decision for you.
1045031719042,DIALOGUESCENE176_DARYL_DIALOGUE21,It's fine. I don't think I can come to a decision on my own.
1045031719043,DIALOGUESCENE177_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I don't think you should join us.
1045031719044,DIALOGUESCENE177_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,If you can not commit yourself to working with others then it might only backfire if I force you into a party.
1045031719045,DIALOGUESCENE177_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,In that case it's probably better to continue with what you're already doing.
1045031719046,DIALOGUESCENE177_DARYL_DIALOGUE4,I see. Then I guess my business here is done.
1045031719047,DIALOGUESCENE177_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Maybe one day you'll find comrades you can fully trust.
1045031719048,DIALOGUESCENE177_DARYL_DIALOGUE6,...Maybe...
1045031719049,DIALOGUESCENE177_DARYL_DIALOGUE7,"Farewell, Guild Master."
1045035913216,DIALOGUESCENE178_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I think you should join us.
1045035913217,DIALOGUESCENE178_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It's safer than to adventure on your own.
1045035913218,DIALOGUESCENE178_DARYL_DIALOGUE3,"Then I will be in your care, Guild Master."
1045035913219,DIALOGUESCENE178_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Welcome to the Guild Daryl.
1045035913220,DIALOGUESCENE179_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,We have to talk.
1045035913221,DIALOGUESCENE179_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen> She doesn't have to do anything! So back off!
1045035913222,DIALOGUESCENE179_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,"No...please, let me handle this."
1045035913223,DIALOGUESCENE179_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE4,B-But your Holiness!
1045035913224,DIALOGUESCENE179_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,Please?
1045035913225,DIALOGUESCENE179_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE6,"...Yes, your Holiness."
1045035913226,DIALOGUESCENE179_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,"...I guess, I owe you an explanation..."
1045035913227,DIALOGUESCENE179_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Seems like it.
1045035913228,DIALOGUESCENE179_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"The goal of the last quest wasn't to save those captives, was it?"
1045035913229,DIALOGUESCENE179_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE10,...
1045035913230,DIALOGUESCENE179_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"The captives were only the bait for somebody more important for us to catch, right?"
1045035913231,DIALOGUESCENE179_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE12,Yes...I was hoping you wouldn't catch on.
1045035913232,DIALOGUESCENE179_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,So you lied to me. Is this how the gods work?
1045035913233,DIALOGUESCENE179_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE14,"...Please not here, Guild Master. Let us talk somewhere no one can hear us."
1045035913234,DIALOGUESCENE180_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE1,"Are you sure, your Holiness?"
1045035913235,DIALOGUESCENE180_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,Yes. I need to talk to the Guild Master alone.
1045035913236,DIALOGUESCENE180_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE3,...I'l be waiting outside. Scream if they do anything.
1045035913237,DIALOGUESCENE180_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,You worry too much.
1045035913238,DIALOGUESCENE180_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE5,...<?fadeOutNPC>
1045035913239,DIALOGUESCENE180_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(He's gone.)
1045035913240,DIALOGUESCENE180_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,"Please don't judge him too harshly, Guild Master. He means well."
1045035913241,DIALOGUESCENE180_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"...Currently, he is the least of my problems."
1045035913242,DIALOGUESCENE180_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,I'm more concerned by the fact that again the Guild has been assigned a quest where the important details have been hidden from us.
1045035913243,DIALOGUESCENE180_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,We all know how well that ended for my friend.
1045035913244,DIALOGUESCENE180_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE11,"...I'm sorry, Guild Master."
1045035913245,DIALOGUESCENE180_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Then tell me why you didn't tell me the whole story.
1045035913246,DIALOGUESCENE181_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>""Because faith is everything."""
1045035913247,DIALOGUESCENE181_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,"""Humans are fickle and incapable of seeing the greater picture. They are easily led astray by knowledge that doesn't concern them."""

1045035913312,DIALOGUESCENE186_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,I honestly have never seen anybody dare to act like that in the presence of the divines. They'd be too afraid of their wrath.

1045035913318,DIALOGUESCENE188_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,Hello Guild Master!
1045035913319,DIALOGUESCENE189_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Is there a way for somebody who is bound to a demon lord to become free again?
1045035913320,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,"Why do you ask, Guild Master? You're not thinking of doing anything stupid, are you?"
1045035913321,DIALOGUESCENE189_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"It's one of my adventurers. She...made a poor choice and now she has one of the marks of the demon lords.
Understandably, she wants to get rid of it."
1045035913322,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,I think I saw the girl. The mark of Belephegor the Slothful if I recall correctly. I wanted to say something but I thought you had your reasons.
1045035913323,DIALOGUESCENE189_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"So, is there a way?"
1045035913324,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,"...Unfortunately, not even the divines can undo a pact made with one of the demon lords. The only one who could undo the pact would be Belephegor himself."
1045035913325,DIALOGUESCENE189_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...So we would need to negotiate with the demon lord himself. Ugh...I don't feel like there is much hope there. How would we even be able to contact him?
1045035913326,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE8,"<?whiteFlash>!!!
R-really? You'd do that?"
1045035913327,DIALOGUESCENE189_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,What are you talking about?
1045035913328,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE10,Ghanenta has offered to help you with your endeavor. He said that he'll organize a meeting between your adventurer and Belephegor himself.
1045035913329,DIALOGUESCENE189_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"(Ghanenta, you just moved up in my number one spot amongst the gods. Although, I don't know how to feel about the fact that gods and demon lords apparently can talk to each other like neighbors.)"
1045035913330,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE12,"...Yes, I'll tell the Guild Master.
 It's done, Guild Master. Ghanenta says that the adventurer will be able to communicate with Belephegor at a certain location."
1045035913331,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE13,"The rest will be up to them, however. To be honest, I don't see how they'll be able to convince Belephegor to take back the deal."
1045035913332,DIALOGUESCENE189_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,"Considering her soul is on the line, it will be at least worth a shot."
1045035913333,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE15,...Ghanenta wants me to give you a warning.
1045035913334,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE16,"Your adventurers need to be careful, Guild Master. Even though Belephegor will most likely not harm your adventurers directly, he is known to enjoy setting people against each other."
1045035913335,DIALOGUESCENE189_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE17,The girl should only meet with Belephegor if she is accompanied by people who she can trust. At least one who'd never betray her.
1045035913336,DIALOGUESCENE189_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,I'll keep that in mind.
1045035913337,DIALOGUESCENE190_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,Do you have any other interesting topics?
1045035913338,DIALOGUESCENE191_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, you really can hear the voices of the gods?"
1045035913339,DIALOGUESCENE191_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,Do I hear scepticism?
1045035913340,DIALOGUESCENE191_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Well, I don't have any proof that you can actually hear the voices of the gods. It could be all a big scam."
1045035913341,DIALOGUESCENE191_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,"Proving it, is surprisingly easy. After all, they tell me that..."

1045035913346,DIALOGUESCENE192_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,A situation? What do you mean?

1045035913353,DIALOGUESCENE193_TAVI_DIALOGUE6," I already gave her a weaker drink, but she still ended up that way."
1045035913354,DIALOGUESCENE193_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,"Why did no one tell me it feels so great to be so light-headed?

Okay fine. But stay still!"

1045040107559,DIALOGUESCENE202_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"(In the end, all I could offer her was a promise, I didn't know I could keep.)"
1045040107560,DIALOGUESCENE203_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,*sniff*...
1045040107561,DIALOGUESCENE203_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>Lily...I promise that we will do everything we can to prevent something like that happening again.
1045040107562,DIALOGUESCENE203_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,"...Thank you, {PROTAGONIST}."
1045040107563,DIALOGUESCENE203_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,"...
...{PROTAGONIST}... Could you tell me a story?"
1045040107564,DIALOGUESCENE203_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,A story? About what?
1045040107565,DIALOGUESCENE203_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,"...I don't know...Maybe about an adventure you had...
Yeah...I'd like that."
1045040107566,DIALOGUESCENE203_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Alright. I'm no bard but I'll try my best to entertain you.
1045040107567,DIALOGUESCENE203_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,(I started telling her one of the strangest adventures I had with Franny when we both were still adventurers. It was a story I hardly ever told anybody because of how unbelievable it sounded.)
1045040107568,DIALOGUESCENE203_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9," (However, Lily listened intently, asked questions, laughed, and cried. Until she fell asleep, and with the help of others, I carried her back to her bed.)"

1045040107578,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE3,I've just received some thrilling news!
1045040107579,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>Some travelers have reported spotting a dragon nearby!
1045040107580,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"
Unnnnnngh...."
1045040107581,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE6,"Is everything alright, Guild Master?"
1045040107582,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,I just heard about a dragon roaming around. What do you think?
1045040107583,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>And why on earth do you look so happy about this?
1045040107584,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE9,"It's a dragon, Guild Master! The prized beast in any saga!"
1045040107585,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE10,What manner of hero would not want to slay at least one in their lifetime?
1045040107586,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,The kind that survives.
1045040107587,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE12,"Don't spoil this for me, Guild Master! The story about the Adventurer Guild really needs at least one dragon in it!"
1045040107588,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE13,"Besides, the Guild has to take care of it!"
1045040107589,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE14,Just think of the possible loss of life and destruction if you just let it be.
1045040107590,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"*Sighs* I hate to admit it, but you have a point."
1045040107591,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,There's even a chance it might target the Guild. It's better to take the fight to it than to let it wreak havoc here.
1045040107592,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,It might be possible for our adventurers to handle a dragon.
1045040107593,DIALOGUESCENE205_VINCENT _DIALOGUE18,"Do you speak from experience, Guild Master?"
1045040107594,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,Do I look like someone with a death wish? I was just trying to be optimistic.
1045040107595,DIALOGUESCENE205_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,Let's just hope it's old or sick or something.
1045040107596,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE1,H-Hello...Are you the Guild Master?
1045040107597,DIALOGUESCENE206_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,That I am. And you are?
1045040107598,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE3,"My name is Elan, Sir! Or Ma'am!"
1045040107599,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE4,"I'm...also an adventurer. 
N-Not for long."
1045040107600,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE5,...I'm actually the one who has been saved by your adventurers not too long ago.
1045040107601,DIALOGUESCENE206_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"(Ah, right! The missing son. I remember the report.)"
1045040107602,DIALOGUESCENE206_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,I feel like I can guess why you're here but why don't you tell me directly.
1045040107603,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE8,I...
1045040107604,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>I'd like to join the Guild!
1045040107605,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE10,"After nearly dying last time, I realized that I underestimated the life of an adventurer and that I still have much to learn."
1045040107606,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE11, By joining the Guild I hope to become a better adventurer.
1045040107607,DIALOGUESCENE206_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,My hunch was correct...
1045040107608,DIALOGUESCENE206_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"So, I know I shouldn't be saying this but...<?whiteFlash><b>why</b>?"
1045040107609,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE14,Huh?
1045040107610,DIALOGUESCENE206_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,Most adventurers don't have much of a choice and end up as adventurers but I don't think that's the same with you.
1045040107611,DIALOGUESCENE206_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,You have a family you can return to.
1045040107612,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE17,...I would be returning to a life as a farmer...
1045040107613,DIALOGUESCENE206_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,...You could still die an ugly death like the one you just narrowly escaped.
1045040107614,DIALOGUESCENE206_ELAN_DIALOGUE19,...
1045040107615,DIALOGUESCENE207_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Go home, Elan. You have a family."
1045040107616,DIALOGUESCENE207_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,That's more than most of us have.
1045040107617,DIALOGUESCENE207_ELAN_DIALOGUE3,...
1045040107618,DIALOGUESCENE207_ELAN_DIALOGUE4,...Maybe you're right.
1045040107619,DIALOGUESCENE207_ELAN_DIALOGUE5,I'll return home. Thank you for your advice.
1045040107620,DIALOGUESCENE208_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I guess I won't be able to discourage you. 
1045040107621,DIALOGUESCENE208_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"So, it might be better to let you join than let you wander off on your own."
1045040107622,DIALOGUESCENE208_ELAN_DIALOGUE3,...Does that mean?
1045040107623,DIALOGUESCENE208_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Yeah, yeah. You're in kid. "
1045040107624,DIALOGUESCENE208_ELAN_DIALOGUE5,"Thank you, Guild Master!"
1045040107625,DIALOGUESCENE208_ELAN_DIALOGUE6,You won't regret it!
1045040107626,DIALOGUESCENE208_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Just try to stay alive, okay?"
1045040107627,DIALOGUESCENE209_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Is it true that the Divine Messenger is really coming here?
1045040107628,DIALOGUESCENE209_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Yes...You seem awfully excited.
1045040107629,DIALOGUESCENE209_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,Of course I am! My mother used to tell me so many stories about her!
1045040107630,DIALOGUESCENE209_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,About how the Divine Messenger was chosen by the gods themselves to deliver us their wisdom. How her beauty transcends mortal imagination and how her presence alone could heal the sick.
1045040107631,DIALOGUESCENE209_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,"I never knew if she even really existed, because there aren't many people that have actually seen her."
1045040107632,DIALOGUESCENE209_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,It's exciting to think that I might be able to see her! It's like getting a glimpse of an unicorn!
1045040107633,DIALOGUESCENE209_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Well, I guess I'm happy, you're happy. But just don't get your hopes up too high."
1045040107634,DIALOGUESCENE209_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Reality usually likes to disappoint people.
1045040107635,DIALOGUESCENE210_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,I imagined the witch to look much scarier.
1045040107636,DIALOGUESCENE210_EMILY_DIALOGUE2,Somebody with sharp teeths and claws and muuuuuuch older.
1045040107637,DIALOGUESCENE210_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,But she looks kinda like...a normal girl.
1045040107638,DIALOGUESCENE210_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Believe me, after seeing her fight, I can say that she is far from normal. "

1045044301828,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,We do not need to accept Quests every day.
1045044301829,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,Adventurers have their own limits and need to rest from time to time. Both mentally and physically.
1045044301830,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,Push them beyond that and they might leave the Guild one way or another.
1045044301831,DIALOGUESCENE215_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(I guess one way is dying.)
1045044301832,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,"Consider just letting this day end, so that our adventurers can recover a bit."
1045044301833,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"The adventurers will thank you, Guild Master!"
1045044301834,DIALOGUESCENE215_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,So where has the swamp hag disappeared to?
1045044301835,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,"...If you're referring to Fiola, then she already left."
1045044301836,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,She was actually the one who told me to give you that advice in her stead.
1045044301837,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,She ...*sigh* said that she hit her mental limit with you for today.
1045044301838,DIALOGUESCENE215_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"...
Would it bother you to deliver my remark so that she doesn't get the last word?"
1045044301839,DIALOGUESCENE215_FALKEN_DIALOGUE13,"It would bother me greatly, Guild Master. Very much so..."
1045044301840,DIALOGUESCENE216_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,What do you think about the incidents with the bandits lately?
1045044301841,DIALOGUESCENE216_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"I don't feel like that much has changed. Sure, they may seem to have increased in number and might be bolder than before but I bet that won't last long."
1045044301842,DIALOGUESCENE216_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,So you don't think the bandits' recent behaviour is unusual?
1045044301843,DIALOGUESCENE216_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"Well, even if it's unusual, it's not like much has changed for us."
1045044301844,DIALOGUESCENE216_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,"After all, if our Adventurers cross paths with bandits they'll usually end up fighting anyway."
1045044301845,DIALOGUESCENE217_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,That's...quite the bold title. In the past some bandits were infamous enough to make names for themselves but crowning himself the king of them all is a first.
1045044301846,DIALOGUESCENE217_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"I nearly forgot that used to be a thing. There used to be so many of them like ""Bloodhound"", ""The Red Scourge"", ""Black Widow"" or ""The Vicious Viper"". What happened to all of them?"
1045044301847,DIALOGUESCENE217_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"They're all dead, Guild Master. Either captured by authority, killed by some random group of adventurers or in case of ""The Vicious Viper"" an accident."
1045044301848,DIALOGUESCENE217_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Ah, right. I remember now.  Didn't ""The Vicious Viper"" die because he was bitten by a poisonous viper?"
1045044301849,DIALOGUESCENE217_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,Yes...It was very ironic.
1045044301850,DIALOGUESCENE218_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,"Be careful, Guild Master."
1045044301851,DIALOGUESCENE218_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,The Quests we received from the Divine Messenger were anything but safe.
1045044301852,DIALOGUESCENE218_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,We've already lost one Guild Master.
1045044301853,DIALOGUESCENE218_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,I don't want it to happen to you too.
1045044301854,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,A dark day for the Adventurer Guild.
1045044301855,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,It's still hard to believe that so many enemies were amongst us and we didn't see it.
1045044301856,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"That night, I was actually walking around with one of the traitors."
1045044301857,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"He was one the new recruits. A young man, I remembered as clumsy but earnest."
1045044301858,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,I remember how nervous he looked that night and just thought it was because he hasn't been doing well in training.
1045044301859,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,But his intentions became clear when he suddenly swiped after my throat with a hidden blade.
1045044301860,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"I was lucky that it was a clumsy, hesitant attempt. Otherwise, we wouldn't have this conversation."
1045044301861,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,"I tried to reason with him but ,maybe because of the chaos that suddenly could be heard all around the Guild, any hesitation he had, quickly left him."
1045044301862,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,"...That day became another reminder of my disability. In my adventuring days I would had no problem to subdue him alive, but with my missing leg I was barely an adequate opponent."
1045044301863,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,In the end I had to kill him...
1045044301864,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,"You know, Guild Master..."
1045044301865,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,The worst thing wasn't the fighting or the killing that night...
1045044301866,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE13,It was the constant doubt you had towards to the people around you. You had no idea who was your friend or your foe.
1045044301867,DIALOGUESCENE219_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,It was chaos...It was no wonder that the majority of the adventurers left after that night.
1045044301868,DIALOGUESCENE220_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,I guess...we won then?
1045044301869,DIALOGUESCENE220_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It would be great if it that were to be the case. But something tells me it's not over.
1045044301870,DIALOGUESCENE220_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"Well, whatever might come next, I have full confidence that you'll handle it."
1045044301871,DIALOGUESCENE221_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So...you like Astrid.
1045044301872,DIALOGUESCENE221_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"Oh, great! It feels like the entire Guild knows about it now and has been gossiping behind my back."
1045044301873,DIALOGUESCENE221_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Well, you did kinda make a scene, so it would be stranger if everyone didn't know."
1045044301874,DIALOGUESCENE221_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,*sighs* I guess that's true...
1045044301875,DIALOGUESCENE221_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>So...when did it start?
1045044301876,DIALOGUESCENE221_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,"Really, Guild Master? Really?"
1045044301877,DIALOGUESCENE221_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,You can't blame me for being curious.
1045044301878,DIALOGUESCENE221_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,*sighs*...Fine.
1045044301879,DIALOGUESCENE222_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,It started years ago when she first joined the Adventurer Guild. She didn't really make a great first impression among us.
1045044301880,DIALOGUESCENE222_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,Hardly a day went by without her getting into a fight with somebody. People naturally assumed the worst of her.
1045044301881,DIALOGUESCENE222_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"But I've realized that she simply cared more than anybody. She never stood quietly by when something happened that she thought was wrong, and while the way she handled it was clumsy..."
1045044301882,DIALOGUESCENE222_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,...it was also kind of beautiful in its own way.
1045044301883,DIALOGUESCENE222_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,I never really knew when I fell in love with her. The realization only hit me when I felt the ugly stings of jealousy upon her getting together with Andrey.
1045044301884,DIALOGUESCENE222_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"After Andrey's betrayal, you never tried to get closer to her?"
1045044301885,DIALOGUESCENE222_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"No, I knew there was no place for me in her heart. In fact, I never intended for her to find out about my feelings."
1045044301886,DIALOGUESCENE222_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,"But, in the end, I told her in the worst way possible."
1045044301887,DIALOGUESCENE223_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>You're not giving up, are you?"
1045044301888,DIALOGUESCENE223_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,...I didn't plan to try in the first place.
1045044301889,DIALOGUESCENE223_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...Then, your feelings for her weren't that strong to begin with. "
1045044301890,DIALOGUESCENE223_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>That's not true!
1045044301891,DIALOGUESCENE223_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Then you should try harder!
1045044301892,DIALOGUESCENE223_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Believe me when I say this...if you don't try, you'll regret it."
1045044301893,DIALOGUESCENE223_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,...
1045044301894,DIALOGUESCENE224_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"You know, for some reason I feel like I've heard the name Falken before."
1045044301895,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,It doesn't surprise me. I used to be a somewhat famous Adventurer a long time ago.
1045044301896,DIALOGUESCENE224_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Really? Did you have some additional titles or an Alias? Because I have a hard time remembering anybody famous with the name ""Falken""."
1045044301897,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,W-well it wasn't anything special. In fact I can't remember it myself. Hahaha!
1045044301898,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,...
1045044301899,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,"I mean it has been years now since I ""retired""."
1045044301900,DIALOGUESCENE224_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...
1045044301901,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,You know...after I lost my leg I was sure my life was over. After all what use was a crippled Adventurer?
1045044301902,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,But then one day Fran appeared to me and asked me to be an instructor for his Adventurer Guild.
1045044301903,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,If it weren't for him I'd probably be begging on some street or more likely already dead by now.
1045044301904,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,...
1045044301905,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,...Do you think we can still save the Guild?
1045044301906,DIALOGUESCENE224_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,I don't know. But I'll try my best.
1045044301907,DIALOGUESCENE224_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,I guess I really can't ask for more than that.
1045044301908,DIALOGUESCENE225_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,"What's the matter, Guild Master?"
1045044301909,DIALOGUESCENE226_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,I'll be here if you need me.
1045044301910,DIALOGUESCENE227_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Anything else that needs to be discussed?

1045044301960,DIALOGUESCENE232_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, did you manage to meet your former comrades?"
1045044301961,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,I did.
1045044301962,DIALOGUESCENE232_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,And how did it go?
1045044301963,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,It...went better than I expected.
1045044301964,DIALOGUESCENE232_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,So they really wanted to talk to you like I said?
1045044301965,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,"No, Guild Master. They did not."
1045044301966,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"Thinking about it now, if they did they could have just approached me normally without the whole tournament thing."
1045044301967,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,"No, Guild Master. They were still mad at me for everything I did and wanted me to know it."
1045044301968,DIALOGUESCENE232_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...I'm sorry to hear that.
1045044301969,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,<?whiteFlash>...I'm not.
1045044301970,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,"You might have been wrong, but your words gave me the push I needed to finally face my past."
1045044301971,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,"We've talked, Guild Master."
1045044301972,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE13,"For the first time since I've known them, we've talked with each other openly and without any reservation."
1045044301973,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,I listened to every complaint they ever had about me. Many things I knew and some things I wasn't aware of. In the end I admitted to them that I was a bad leader and that I would do anything to make it up to them.
1045044301974,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15,And do you know what they wanted from me?
1045044301975,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE16,They wanted me to pay the next round of beer! Hahahaha!
1045044301976,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE17,...You can't imagine the relief I felt when I heard that. I imagined that they would say that it would be impossible to make it up to them.
1045044301977,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE18,"However, it seems after getting it out all of their system, they were ready to forgive me just like that."
1045044301978,DIALOGUESCENE232_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,I'm glad it worked out for you.
1045044301979,DIALOGUESCENE232_FALKEN_DIALOGUE20,"It wouldn't have been possible without you, Guild Master."
1045044301980,DIALOGUESCENE233_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Guild Master! You've got a letter.
1045044301981,DIALOGUESCENE233_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,A letter? From whom?
1045044301982,DIALOGUESCENE233_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"It has the seal of House Greyhorn, so I think it might be from Lady Cecilia."
1045048496128,DIALOGUESCENE233_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"I see.
Well, let's see what she has to say."
1045048496129,DIALOGUESCENE234_CECILIA_DIALOGUE1,"My Esteemed Guild Master,"
1045048496130,DIALOGUESCENE234_CECILIA_DIALOGUE2,"I, Lady Cecilia from House Greyhorn, like to express my gratitude for the service you have done for me. My brother has returned to me safely and unharmed thanks to the interventions of your adventurers."
1045048496131,DIALOGUESCENE234_CECILIA_DIALOGUE3,"Despite your lack of manners, it seems that you are indeed able to live up to the title of Guild Master of the Adventurer Guild. 
"
1045048496132,DIALOGUESCENE234_CECILIA_DIALOGUE4,"Let it be known, that I, Lady Cecilia, bestow upon you a modicum of praise for your effort and may you strive to improve and aspire to meet the standards befitting to a person of your station.
Lady Cecilia"
1045048496133,DIALOGUESCENE235_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...Now I'm a little bit irritated.
1045048496134,DIALOGUESCENE235_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>C-come on, Guild Master! It's just her unique way of expressing gratitude. I'm sure she's honestly grateful for what the Guild has done for her!"
1045048496135,DIALOGUESCENE235_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"*Sighs* Maybe...
I was just hoping for more. We really didn't get paid enough for that Quest."
1045048496136,DIALOGUESCENE235_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"Don't say that, Guild Master! We've saved a noble! Our reputation has risen again and now even some influential people have started to take notice of us. That's worth more than gold."
1045048496137,DIALOGUESCENE235_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"I guess you're right, Falken. The Guild is growing thanks to that and that's all that matters. But we still got a long way to go."
1045048496138,DIALOGUESCENE235_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Let us get back to work.
1045048496139,DIALOGUESCENE235_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"Yes, Guild Master!"
1045048496140,DIALOGUESCENE236_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,It seems like the bandits have become bolder than usual.
1045048496141,DIALOGUESCENE236_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,We're getting more and more quests related to bandit activities.
1045048496142,DIALOGUESCENE236_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I guess the whole thing has also its good side.
1045048496143,DIALOGUESCENE236_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,Not something Fran would have ever said.
1045048496144,DIALOGUESCENE236_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,But it's what you were also thinking.
1045048496145,DIALOGUESCENE236_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,...I hate how alike we think...
1045048496146,DIALOGUESCENE237_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"Apparently, a lot of the bandits have started to band together under a man calling himself the ""Bandit King"". They say that he essentially already has a small army under his command."
1045048496147,DIALOGUESCENE237_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,"They also say that with every day passing, their numbers swell as if they're being lured by a siren call, beckoning the low lifes and scums to join."
1045048496148,DIALOGUESCENE237_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,...<?whiteFlash>Can you hear it?
1045048496149,DIALOGUESCENE237_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Hahaha....Very funny, Fiola."
1045048496150,DIALOGUESCENE238_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,I had hoped we would have nothing more to do with her.
1045048496151,DIALOGUESCENE238_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,But of course my second-most hated person decides to suck up to my most hated person.
1045048496152,DIALOGUESCENE238_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Awww, I'm just your second-most hated?"
1045048496153,DIALOGUESCENE238_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,Keep that up and you'll be back on the number one spot in no time.
1045048496154,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,...Why do you have to do this to me? I don't want to remember that day.
1045048496155,DIALOGUESCENE239_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...I need to know more. I need to know how exactly Fran died...
1045048496156,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,...
1045048496157,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"...One night, it just happened. We were awoken by the sound of people fighting around the Guild ground."
1045048496158,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,"At first we thought, it might have been adventurers doing a late night training but then there were screams mixed into the sounds."
1045048496159,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,"When we went outside, it was like a picture of hell was greeting us. "
1045048496160,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,Adventurers all over the place were fighting each other. People who just shared their meals the day before were suddenly engaged in battles to the death.
1045048496161,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,At the time we had no idea what was happening.
1045048496162,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,Franny was the first to regain his composure and told me to hide.
1045048496163,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,...I begged him to hide with me...I told him that he wasn't an adventurer anymore...
1045048496164,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,But he only smiled at me and apologized. Before I knew it he was already gone.
1045048496165,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,The fighting didn't stop until the next morning. At that point most of the people were either dead or have fled.
1045048496166,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,"They brought his body to me...
It was...i-it..."
1045048496167,DIALOGUESCENE239_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Stop...
1045048496168,DIALOGUESCENE239_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,...I don't want to hear it...
1045048496169,DIALOGUESCENE239_FIOLA_DIALOGUE16,"...Please I need some time now, {PROTAGONIST}."
1045048496170,DIALOGUESCENE240_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Do you feel anything when you see the witch?
1045048496171,DIALOGUESCENE240_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,...You're wondering if I hate her.
1045048496172,DIALOGUESCENE240_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I do.
1045048496173,DIALOGUESCENE240_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,...If you asked me before she was sitting in the dungeon I never knew about then maybe.
1045048496174,DIALOGUESCENE240_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,But now...it feels pointless. I don't even really care if she dies or not.
1045048496175,DIALOGUESCENE240_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,"It won't bring back Fran and even if it did, he wouldn't want it."
1045048496176,DIALOGUESCENE240_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,...Do you hate her?
1045048496177,DIALOGUESCENE240_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...
1045048496178,DIALOGUESCENE241_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,You know you could just go home. There is no reason anymore for you to be here.
1045048496179,DIALOGUESCENE241_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,This is my home. Where else should I be?
1045048496180,DIALOGUESCENE241_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,You know what I mean.
1045048496181,DIALOGUESCENE241_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"Don't be ridiculous. Even if I wanted to return back to that place, it's not like I'm welcome there anymore."
1045048496182,DIALOGUESCENE241_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Your fault for getting involved with Adventurers.
1045048496183,DIALOGUESCENE241_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,I don't regret it. 
1045048496184,DIALOGUESCENE241_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,"Well, I do regret getting myself involved with you..."
1045048496185,DIALOGUESCENE241_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,...but I do not regret falling in love.
1045048496186,DIALOGUESCENE241_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...Tsk! Love!
1045048496187,DIALOGUESCENE241_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,You've been nothing but a pain in the neck for me ever since I met you.
1045048496188,DIALOGUESCENE241_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,What a coincidence. I was just thinking the same.
1045048496189,DIALOGUESCENE242_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"You know.
I'm suprised that you even care that some people lost their son."
1045048496190,DIALOGUESCENE242_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,So what?
1045048496191,DIALOGUESCENE242_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,What do you care what I think about some Quests?
1045048496192,DIALOGUESCENE242_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Well, I just never thought you were a creature capable of feeling compassion."
1045048496193,DIALOGUESCENE242_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,*Sighs*. Is that all you came to see me for?
1045048496194,DIALOGUESCENE242_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,To make a snidey remark?
1045048496195,DIALOGUESCENE242_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Pretty much.
1045048496196,DIALOGUESCENE242_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,I'll never understand how Fran was able to be friends with you.
1045048496197,DIALOGUESCENE243_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"So, you didn't take the Quest."
1045048496198,DIALOGUESCENE243_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It didn't seem worth the payment.
1045048496199,DIALOGUESCENE243_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I don't want to risk an adventurer's life for barely something.
1045048496200,DIALOGUESCENE243_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,...
1045048496201,DIALOGUESCENE243_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,I expect very little of you.
1045048496202,DIALOGUESCENE243_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,And even then you managed to disappoint me.
1045048496203,DIALOGUESCENE244_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"So, the adventurers couldn't save him."
1045048496204,DIALOGUESCENE244_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,Not the outcome I hoped for.
1045048496205,DIALOGUESCENE244_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,An adventurer's life is cheap. It happens.
1045048496206,DIALOGUESCENE244_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,I think it was too much to hope for some uplifting words from you.
1045048496207,DIALOGUESCENE245_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,I'm glad we were able to save the young man but are you sure about letting him join the Guild?
1045048496208,DIALOGUESCENE245_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,He's old enough to make his own decision.

1045048496210,DIALOGUESCENE245_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"I hope you'll understand that whatever happens to him now, will be your responsibility."
1045048496211,DIALOGUESCENE246_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,I'm glad the adventurers were able to save the young man.
1045048496212,DIALOGUESCENE246_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,I hope he'll stop being an adventurer now and go back to his family.
1045048496213,DIALOGUESCENE246_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,It's rare that we share an opinion.
1045048496214,DIALOGUESCENE246_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,I guess there really is a first time for everything.

1045048496244,DIALOGUESCENE252_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,This one is important and should be done as soon as possible. It has been paid in advance for years.
1045048496245,DIALOGUESCENE252_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,For years?
1045048496246,DIALOGUESCENE252_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,At that point does it really matter if our adventurers do it a few weeks later?
1045048496247,DIALOGUESCENE252_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,*sighs* Just do the damn quest. It's just picking rainbow flowers.
1045048496248,DIALOGUESCENE252_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,The adventurers will be done with the task within an afternoon and they don't even have to fight anything.
1045048496249,DIALOGUESCENE253_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>And there's the jinxing. Something horrible is bound to happen now. I wonder which adventurers I'm going to send to certain doom now.

1045048496252,DIALOGUESCENE253_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,(I'm wondering if ordering a funeral in advance is cheaper.)

1045048496268,DIALOGUESCENE258_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,It's from an old couple who can't afford much.
1045048496269,DIALOGUESCENE258_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...What's the Quest about?
1045048496270,DIALOGUESCENE258_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,They're missing their son.
1045048496271,DIALOGUESCENE258_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,Their son has recently decided to become an adventurer. One that isn't affiliated with the Adventurer Guild.
1045048496272,DIALOGUESCENE258_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,They said that they lost contact with him after he accepted his first quest.
1045048496273,DIALOGUESCENE258_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...That doesn't bode well...
1045048496274,DIALOGUESCENE258_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,Now they're asking us to find him.
1045048496275,DIALOGUESCENE258_FIOLA_DIALOGUE14,They're...clinging to the hope that he is still alive.
1045048496276,DIALOGUESCENE258_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,...I'll think about it.

1045048496281,DIALOGUESCENE259_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,I know I'm always saying you're a witch but that was just to insult you.
1045048496282,DIALOGUESCENE259_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Do I have to think of something else now?

1045052690432,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,Ughh..........
1045052690433,DIALOGUESCENE260_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"What's the matter, Emily?"
1045052690434,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,I'm just sooooo frustrated that I still haven't found the Flower of Eternity.
1045052690435,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,I'm pretty sure I have searched most of the area by now...
1045052690436,DIALOGUESCENE260_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,And there is really no mention in the diary where it actually is?
1045052690437,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,That's the confusing part.
1045052690438,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,There are actually lots of places mentioned in the diary. Like the flower was in all of them.
1045052690439,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE8,Maybe I'm misunderstanding the diary. The language has changed a lot since the time of my ancestor.
1045052690440,DIALOGUESCENE260_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...
1045052690441,DIALOGUESCENE260_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Or maybe the Flower just doesn't exist after all.
1045052690442,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE11,No...that can't be...
1045052690443,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE12,It...has to...
1045052690444,DIALOGUESCENE260_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"...Sorry, I might have spoken too soon."
1045052690445,DIALOGUESCENE260_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,You said most areas. Doesn't that mean there are some more where you haven't looked?
1045052690446,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE15,"Yes, but those areas are more dangerous than the usual places."
1045052690447,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE16,The adventurers escorting me....might get hurt.
1045052690448,DIALOGUESCENE260_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,Then I just assign stronger adventurers for you.
1045052690449,DIALOGUESCENE260_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"I promised, didn't I? To help you with your search."
1045052690450,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE19,"Thank you, Guild Master...."
1045052690451,DIALOGUESCENE260_EMILY_DIALOGUE20,I really appreciate it.
1045052690452,DIALOGUESCENE261_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Hey Emily!
I wanted to see how you're doing since the last search was another bust.
I...."

1045052690454,DIALOGUESCENE262_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045052690455,DIALOGUESCENE262_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What are you doing?
1045052690456,DIALOGUESCENE262_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,I'm pretending to be a flower.
1045052690457,DIALOGUESCENE262_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,"I thought if I go into the mindset of a flower, I might understand where the Flower Of Eternity might be hiding! "
1045052690458,DIALOGUESCENE262_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...Does it help?
1045052690459,DIALOGUESCENE262_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,"Not yet, but I might have to just commit more to the role."
1045052690460,DIALOGUESCENE262_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,Could you hand me the fertilizer over there? It's made out of troll sh....
1045052690461,DIALOGUESCENE262_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>Alright! That's the cue for you to stop!
1045052690462,DIALOGUESCENE263_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Now, let's get you out of there!"
1045052690463,DIALOGUESCENE263_EMILY_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>W-Wait, Guildmaster! I'm not done yet! I haven't even tried to photosynthesise yet!"
1045052690464,DIALOGUESCENE263_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>Just stop with the nonsense! This can't be healthy for you!
1045052690465,DIALOGUESCENE263_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,"No! Let go! 
<?shakeScreen>My Flowerbed!!!!!"
1045052690466,DIALOGUESCENE264_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,...
1045052690467,DIALOGUESCENE264_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Were you really going to go so far as to use feces on yourself?
1045052690468,DIALOGUESCENE264_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>What else am I supposed to do? I'm sure at this point we have practically looked behind every blade of grass in the area.
1045052690469,DIALOGUESCENE264_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...I actually wanted to say this before but I wasn't sure how you'd react but...
1045052690470,DIALOGUESCENE264_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>...maybe it's time to give up?
1045052690471,DIALOGUESCENE264_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>What?! No!
1045052690472,DIALOGUESCENE264_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,I would sooner comb through every blade of grass in the continent if I have to.
1045052690473,DIALOGUESCENE264_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Why is this so important to you?
1045052690474,DIALOGUESCENE264_EMILY_DIALOGUE9,...
1045052690475,DIALOGUESCENE264_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,I wasn't entirely truthful to you Guild Master.
1045052690476,DIALOGUESCENE264_EMILY_DIALOGUE11,My full name is Emily Altem...
1045052690477,DIALOGUESCENE264_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,<?whiteFlash>Altem? Why does that name sound so familiar?
1045052690478,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,"It may be because amongst alchemists, it has become a slur for charlatans. "
1045052690479,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE2,"When I said that my ancestor was looking for the Flower of Eternity himself, he wasn't just doing it for fun."
1045052690480,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,He was actually sponsored by the king of that time to search for it after bragging that he knew exactly where to look and baiting the old king by claiming he could brew an elixir of immortality with it.
1045052690481,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,"Most people who claimed such things would have probably been entirely dismissed, but our family was different."
1045052690482,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,We were famed for being great alchemists. Respected and trusted by everyone in the alchemist community. 
1045052690483,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,Only because of that the king took him seriously and funded his search for the Flower of Eternity.
1045052690484,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,"My ancestor was gone for months and spent every single coin he was given. However, ultimately he returned empty-handed."
1045052690485,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE8,"Ever since then, my family has been mocked as liars and charlatans."
1045052690486,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE9,We eventually stopped using our surname in public...
1045052690487,DIALOGUESCENE265_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,...even more so after we lost all our assets over time to pay back the royal family.
1045052690488,DIALOGUESCENE266_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>But the Flower of Eternity exists!
1045052690489,DIALOGUESCENE266_EMILY_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>According to his diary, he found it!"
1045052690490,DIALOGUESCENE266_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,If I could just find it too then I might finally restore our name! 
1045052690491,DIALOGUESCENE266_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,In that case why didn't he return with the flower?
1045052690492,DIALOGUESCENE266_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,I... I don't know.
1045052690493,DIALOGUESCENE266_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,All I know is that he actually lied and claimed that he couldn't find it.
1045052690494,DIALOGUESCENE266_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,I...I don't know why he would put our whole family through this.
1045052690495,DIALOGUESCENE266_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...
1045052690496,DIALOGUESCENE267_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>Sorry Emily, I spoke too soon."
1045052690497,DIALOGUESCENE267_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"If it exists, then we will find it!"
1045052690498,DIALOGUESCENE267_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,"So, you'll still help me?"
1045052690499,DIALOGUESCENE267_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Of course! You promised me you'd create an awesome potion with the Flower of Eternity, didn't you?
"
1045052690500,DIALOGUESCENE267_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,"...Thank you, Guild Master!"
1045052690501,DIALOGUESCENE268_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,"Oh, hello, Guild Master."
1045052690502,DIALOGUESCENE268_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Hello, Emily. I wanted to see how you're doing."
1045052690503,DIALOGUESCENE268_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,I'm fine. I finally know now why my ancestor lied about the Flower Of Eternity.
1045052690504,DIALOGUESCENE268_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,And I'm glad he did. It's better if no one knows that she exists.
1045052690505,DIALOGUESCENE268_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,And you're fine with it? You've been looking for it for so long. What about your family name?
1045052690506,DIALOGUESCENE268_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,I'm already used to it anyway. And who cares?
1045052690507,DIALOGUESCENE268_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,"The adventurers appreciate my work, so I shouldn't care what other alchemists might think of me."
1045052690508,DIALOGUESCENE268_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"So, what are you going to do now?
With your search concluded, will you be returning home?"
1045052690509,DIALOGUESCENE268_EMILY_DIALOGUE9,"I actually would like to stay here. Making potions for adventurers has been fun, and I've really gotten used to the people here."
1045052690510,DIALOGUESCENE268_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,"So, I'd still want to be your alchemist if it's alright with you."
1045052690511,DIALOGUESCENE268_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"Of course, it is."
1045052690512,DIALOGUESCENE268_EMILY_DIALOGUE12,Great!
1045052690513,DIALOGUESCENE269_HOPI_DIALOGUE1,"Yeah, Hopi happy everyone happy!"
1045052690514,DIALOGUESCENE269_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>What are you still doing here?!
1045052690515,DIALOGUESCENE269_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,Hopi actually asked me if it would be okay for him to stay here for a while.
1045052690516,DIALOGUESCENE269_EMILY_DIALOGUE4,"He wants to learn more about humans, and I thought I could use an assistant."
1045052690517,DIALOGUESCENE269_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Shouldn't you have asked me?
1045052690518,DIALOGUESCENE269_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,I thought you'd probably be fine with it.
1045052690519,DIALOGUESCENE269_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,Probably.
1045052690520,DIALOGUESCENE269_HOPI_DIALOGUE8,"<?shakeScreen>Hopi very helpful. Human tribe teach Hopi about way of humans.
Hopi can teach Human way of Hopi's tribe.
"
1045052690521,DIALOGUESCENE269_EMILY_DIALOGUE9,"<?shakeScreen>You hear that, Guild Master? He can probably teach the adventurers some neat new tricks!
And he can stay here with me!"
1045052690522,DIALOGUESCENE269_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,"Please, Guild Master!"
1045052690523,DIALOGUESCENE269_HOPI_DIALOGUE11,"Please, Guild Master!"
1045052690524,DIALOGUESCENE269_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,*Sighs*I never said I was against it. Just would have preferred if you had discussed this with me before.
1045052690525,DIALOGUESCENE269_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Hopi can stay.
1045052690526,DIALOGUESCENE269_EMILY_DIALOGUE14,"<?shakeScreen>You're the best, Guild Master!"
1045052690527,DIALOGUESCENE269_HOPI_DIALOGUE15,"<?shakeScreen>You the best, Guild Master!"
1045052690528,DIALOGUESCENE269_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,"(...I'll never be able to say no to these two, am I?)"
1045052690529,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, with the part from the Flower of Eternity, what can you actually make with it?"
1045052690530,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE2,It's actually quite scary. I made a few tests with small samples but I'm certain that there are a lot of effects I could achieve with it but there are two that are just...miraculous.
1045052690531,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,One of the possible effects is getting a body at its peak condition and making it unable to age. They can still die though.
1045052690532,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"So, basically eternal youth? What's the other effect?"
1045052690533,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,The other effect...is even more unbelievable but...I think I can bring back the dead.
1045052690534,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045052690535,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,"I mean really bring them back. Not like a necromancer, but actually reviving a person to the state before they died."
1045052690536,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>Really?! You mean we can really revive a person?
1045052690537,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE9,O-only someone who died just recently!
1045052690538,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,O-oh...
1045052690539,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE11,"I'm sorry, Guild Master."
1045052690540,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,(Was my disappointment that obvious?)
1045052690541,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"So, which one do you want to make?"
1045052690542,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE14,I wanted to let you decide. I think either of those two would prove helpful to the Guild.
1045052690543,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,Are you sure? I still wouldn't mind if you decide to make it for yourself and sell it. You'd be set for the rest of your life.
1045052690544,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE16,I'm sure. I don't want to risk other people knowing that the Flower Of Eternity exists and I wouldn't even have it if weren't for you.
1045052690545,DIALOGUESCENE270_EMILY_DIALOGUE17,"So, I think it's just fair that the Guild gets the potion I make in the end."
1045052690546,DIALOGUESCENE270_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"Thanks, Emily. I will make good use of it."
1045052690547,DIALOGUESCENE271_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,It's rather surprising how much trouble these bandits seem to cause for you. I was sure that when you nobles were getting involved that it would have been a done deal.
1045052690548,DIALOGUESCENE271_GILBERT_DIALOGUE2,I have to shamefully admit that I was under the same impression but in the end it was us who got defeated.
1045052690549,DIALOGUESCENE271_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Because you underestimated them?
1045052690550,DIALOGUESCENE271_GILBERT_DIALOGUE4,"...I feel like it's more than that. I always thought that they were no ordinary bandits considering the reputation they have built up in such a short time. 
"
1045052690551,DIALOGUESCENE271_GILBERT_DIALOGUE5,"But even then they far exceeded my expectations. From their strength to their equipment. 
It feels as if this is more than just a bandit problem."
1045052690552,DIALOGUESCENE271_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,What more could it be?
1045052690553,DIALOGUESCENE271_GILBERT_DIALOGUE7,I don't know. Maybe I'm just overthinking.
1045052690554,DIALOGUESCENE272_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I wish your sister would behave a little more like you. 
1045052690555,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE2,I understand what you're saying and I hope you'll forgive her.
1045052690556,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE3,She didn't use to be like this in the past.
1045052690557,DIALOGUESCENE272_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,You mean she was well-behaved?
1045052690558,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE5,"Hahaha! No, I mean she was less conscious about her position as a noble."
1045052690559,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE6,"For the longest time I could remember, Cecil wasn't even aware of the distinction between nobles and commoners and had a hard time grasping the concept."
1045052690560,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE7,In the past she would often play with the servants' children or try to help with their chores when she saw them working.
1045052690561,DIALOGUESCENE272_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,(That's certainly hard to believe if you see her now.)
1045052690562,DIALOGUESCENE272_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,What changed?
1045052690563,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE10,...Our parents eventually put a stop to it.
1045052690564,DIALOGUESCENE272_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,You mean they didn't before?
1045052690565,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE12,"No. You see, it's common for noble households to place their children in care of nannies, while the parents would preoccupy themselves with their social obligations. It was the same for my sister."
1045052690566,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE13,"Her nanny was a good woman. She always tried her best for my little sister, treating her like she was her own daughter.
However, she could be a bit too lenient at times. "
1045052690567,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE14,"While some nannies would focus on instilling traditional manners and etiquette expected of a noble, she prioritized my sister's happiness above all else."
1045052690568,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE15,"But as distanced as my parents were, they still eventually found out about my sister's inappropriate behavior."
1045052690569,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE16,"Unlike me, my sister was of some importance to them, as she was the only daughter of the Greyhorn Household and it wasn't long until her nanny had to bear the consequences."
1045052690570,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE17,"She was fired shortly after and had to leave.
Ever since then my sister's behavior has changed. I think, she blames herself for what has happened."
1045052690571,DIALOGUESCENE272_GILBERT_DIALOGUE18,"So, please forgive her if she seems to be disrespectful. She believes she has to act that way because that is what is expected of her."
1045052690572,DIALOGUESCENE272_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,...
1045052690573,DIALOGUESCENE273_GILBERT_DIALOGUE1,I'll be here if you need me.
1045052690574,DIALOGUESCENE274_GILBERT_DIALOGUE1,Hello Guild Master! Anything you want to talk about?
1045052690575,DIALOGUESCENE275_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,You're quite different from what I expected.
1045052690576,DIALOGUESCENE275_GILBERT_DIALOGUE2,How so?
1045052690577,DIALOGUESCENE275_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"I've met a lot of nobles in my past and it's hard to remember one who didn't look down on me. Even if they tried to hide it, it was easy to tell."
1045052690578,DIALOGUESCENE275_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I don't get that feeling with you.
1045052690579,DIALOGUESCENE275_GILBERT_DIALOGUE5,I guess growing up as the unimportant fourth son has a way to humble you.
1045052690580,DIALOGUESCENE275_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...Did you know that they weren't looking for you?
1045052690581,DIALOGUESCENE275_GILBERT_DIALOGUE7,...It's at least something that didn't surprise me. Our family is not particularly close or affectionate. 
1045052690582,DIALOGUESCENE275_GILBERT_DIALOGUE8,My parents are much more invested in playing their political games and my older brothers will probably tear each other apart for the inheritance.
1045052690583,DIALOGUESCENE275_GILBERT_DIALOGUE9,But I'm not particularly sad about it. I can already consider myself lucky enough to be left alone. 
1045052690584,DIALOGUESCENE275_GILBERT_DIALOGUE10,There are no expectations on me and I don't have rivalries with my elder brothers as long as I keep my head down.
1045056884736,DIALOGUESCENE275_GILBERT_DIALOGUE11,And I do have one special bond in the family in the form of my little adorable baby sister. Seeing her sometimes really heals my soul.
1045056884737,DIALOGUESCENE275_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"(Well, at least he has a good attitude about it.)"
1045056884738,DIALOGUESCENE276_GILBERT_DIALOGUE1,Anything else you like to know?
1045056884739,DIALOGUESCENE277_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,Ugh...I feel like vomiting.
1045056884740,DIALOGUESCENE277_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,That's a hangover you're feeling.
1045056884741,DIALOGUESCENE277_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,This is the worst. Why do people even drink? I'll never touch a drop of alcohol again!
1045056884742,DIALOGUESCENE277_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"How often have I heard that before? But as a divine spellcaster, you do have a remedy for it.
Just cast Cure on yourself, and you should feel fine."
1045056884743,DIALOGUESCENE277_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,"Really? Well, let me try that."
1045056884744,DIALOGUESCENE277_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,"<?whiteFlash>Much better! Thank you, Guild Master!"
1045056884745,DIALOGUESCENE277_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Don't mention it.
1045056884746,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,"... And also thank you for keeping me company yesterday.
I was a bit of a mess, wasn't I?"
1045056884747,DIALOGUESCENE278_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It seemed like you needed it.
1045056884748,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,"... I just wanted to forget it all for one day. 
The war between the demon lords and the gods.
The fact that I'm the Divine Messenger."
1045056884749,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,...The fact that I'm not even the master of my own body.
1045056884750,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,"But I can't run away from it any longer...I've been ignoring the gods for days now.
They made it clear that I can not put it off any longer. I have to contact them."
1045056884751,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,Now...
1045056884752,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,"I-I'm afraid, Guild Master. I don't think I can face them on my own anymore."
1045056884753,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE8,...Can you be at my side for this?
1045056884754,DIALOGUESCENE278_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"(Meeting the gods? At this point, I'm not sure what to think about the gods, so I'm a bit hesitant but...)"
1045056884755,DIALOGUESCENE278_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Of course. What do I need to do?
1045056884756,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE11,"Just take my hand, and you'll be there with me."
1045056884757,DIALOGUESCENE278_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"Alright. 
(I take her hand.)"
1045056884758,DIALOGUESCENE278_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"You're not alone in this, Lily."
1045056884759,DIALOGUESCENE278_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE14,Thank you... {PROTAGONIST}.
1045056884760,DIALOGUESCENE279_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?greyFlash>(It felt like I was suddenly pulled into an endless dark space. Where the only other thing I could see at my side was Lily.)
1045056884761,DIALOGUESCENE280_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"(Suddenly, a celestial light appeared in the darkness, revealing a giant silhouette.)"
1045056884762,DIALOGUESCENE280_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE2,"I see you brought the Guild Master with you, child."
1045056884763,DIALOGUESCENE280_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(Lily started to hold my hand tighter and seemed frightened.)
1045056884764,DIALOGUESCENE280_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE4,There is no need to be afraid. We didn't call upon you for punishment.
1045056884765,DIALOGUESCENE280_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE5,"It is rather fortuitous that you have brought them with you.
For there is a lot we have to tell both of you."
1045056884766,DIALOGUESCENE280_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...Are you a god?
1045056884767,DIALOGUESCENE280_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE7,"I am Ghanenta, the one you mortals worship as the God of Love and Compassion."
1045056884768,DIALOGUESCENE280_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Where are the other gods?
1045056884769,DIALOGUESCENE280_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE9,"I've convinced them to let me address you on my own, as many of my brothers and sisters lack the...tactfulness when it comes to interacting with humans."
1045056884770,DIALOGUESCENE280_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE10,"I-if I'm not going to get punished, then why did you call for me?"
1045056884771,DIALOGUESCENE280_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE11,"To mend the schism that has formed between us, child. We are aware that you can not trust us blindly any longer, and time is dwindling. Not much longer, and the cultists will have amassed enough souls."
1045056884772,DIALOGUESCENE280_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Enough souls for what?
1045056884773,DIALOGUESCENE280_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE13,"It's time for you to know the truth. If possible, we would have avoided this scenario, but circumstances are forcing our hand."
1045056884774,DIALOGUESCENE280_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE14,"However, first you need to understand the relationship between the Gods and the Demon Lords."
1045056884775,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE1,"In ages past, Gods and Demon Lords waged a relentless war for dominion over human souls. It was a brutal war. "
1045056884776,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE2,"Once, the universe was teeming with many worlds inhabitated by humans, but each encounter between Gods and Demon Lords on the battlefield, resulted in their annihilation."
1045056884777,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE3,"This war endured for millenias until only seven Gods, seven Demon Lords and one world remained. With the same numbers on each side, we were evenly matched."
1045056884778,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE4,More battles would mean the annihilation of one side and neither side were certain that they would win.
1045056884779,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE5,"So, we stopped fighting each other and instead made a pact. "
1045056884780,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE6,"There would be no longer direct confrontations. Instead representatives amongst the humans were employed to gather as many souls as possible for each side, with minimal intervention from the Gods and Demon Lords."
1045056884781,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE7,"Thus, the concept of the church with their Divine Messenger and the Cultists and their Witch was born."
1045056884782,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE8,"We have achieved a peaceful equilibrium and since that time then, our endeavors have been dedicated to preserving and sustaining this delicate balance."
1045056884783,DIALOGUESCENE281_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,That sounds like you're fine with letting the cultists exists.
1045056884784,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE10,"The followers of the Demon Lords are not allowed to be ever wiped out. We aim to gain the upper hand, but never to win completely."
1045056884785,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE11,"If we do, the Demon Lords will be forced to march to war once again.
Neither we nor they desire that conflict."
1045056884786,DIALOGUESCENE281_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Then what about all those souls the Demon Lords do manage to gather? What happens to them?
1045056884787,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE13,"It's better for you if you don't know. Just live with the knowledge, that it's a necessary price to keep the peace."
1045056884788,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE14,"You might be under the impression that we don't care about your fate, but we do. However, we do not see humanity as individual souls."
1045056884789,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE15,We cannot jeopardize the fate of all of humanity with our demise for the sake of a few unfortunate souls.
1045056884790,DIALOGUESCENE281_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,...
1045056884791,DIALOGUESCENE281_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE17,"However, you need to know that this peace is in danger of getting broken. For we the seven Divines..."
1045056884792,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE1,...are currently only six.
1045056884793,DIALOGUESCENE282_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>!!!!
1045056884794,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE3,"We expect, you understand the consequences should the Demon Lords become privy to our disadvantage."
1045056884795,DIALOGUESCENE282_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"(With a truce built on a power balance? Of course, it would shatter the moment one side becomes weaker.)"
1045056884796,DIALOGUESCENE282_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,B-But I'm sure you were always seven when I heard your voices.
1045056884797,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE6,A ruse. It takes all our power to hide our number from the demon lords.
1045056884798,DIALOGUESCENE282_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,What happened to the seventh god?
1045056884799,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE8,The Empyrean Emperor. We're certain that you have heard of him at this point.
1045056884800,DIALOGUESCENE282_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Yeah... an ancient ruler that had some ties with the witch and the demon lords.
1045056884801,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE10,"Indeed.
He's the one who managed to seal one of us."
1045056884802,DIALOGUESCENE282_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE11,"H-How is that even possible?
<?shakeScreen>You're gods!"
1045056884803,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE12,"We, too, did not believe it to be possible, and therein lay our mistake."
1045056884804,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE13,"The Emperor had already drawn our attention—an immortal sovereign who forged an empire unparalleled by any human, where the adoration from his subjects surpassed even our own."
1045056884805,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE14,"Intrigued, we granted him an audience through the Divine Messenger when he sought one."
1045056884806,DIALOGUESCENE282_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,Despite knowing his ties with the demon lords?
1045056884807,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE16,"A single soul selling themselves to the demon lords, means very little to us. We had a pact after all."
1045056884808,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE17,"However, the audience proved to be a trap. When our sister, Solara, sought to communicate directly by possessing the Divine Messenger, she found herself ensnared and sealed away."
1045056884809,DIALOGUESCENE282_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,For what purpose?
1045056884810,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE19,"We do not know. Despite his ties with the demon lords, we do not think it was done for their sake."
1045056884811,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE20,"The Demon Lords remain oblivious to their advantage over us, and it appears that he was deliberately concealing our sister's disappearance from them."
1045056884812,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE21,"However, his goal was of no importance to us. Our focus was on the retrieval of our sister."
1045056884813,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE22,"But our Divine Messenger was killed immediately after the sealing was done, and due to our pact with the demon lords our options were limited without an avatar. 
We've debated for a long time what to do and in the end we took a risk."
1045056884814,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE23,We violated the pact and used our power to destroy the empyrean Empire.
1045056884815,DIALOGUESCENE282_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,The mysterious fall of the Empyreans... it was you?
1045056884816,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE25,"It was.
With our power, we ceased them all to be—a tranquil demise. Yet, we have violated the contract and we had to answer to the demon lords."
1045056884817,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE26,It took a considerable number of souls to uphold the peace and have them overlook the transgression. 
1045056884818,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE27,We also had to mask the true nature of the cleansing by claiming that the Empyreans were worshipping false idols and showing disrespect to our sanctuaries.
1045056884819,DIALOGUESCENE282_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE28,Dear gods...all those people.
1045056884820,DIALOGUESCENE282_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE29,Couldn't you just have killed the emperor himself? Why drag all those other people into it?
1045056884821,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE30,We could not afford to take any risks. Any person within that empire might have been part of his scheme and posed a potential source of information through which the Demon Lords could learn of our missing sister.
1045056884822,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE31,"No, there was no alternative."
1045056884823,DIALOGUESCENE282_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE32,That...that can't be true...
1045056884824,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE33,"Our plan was to locate and liberate our sister using our next Divine Messenger. However, once more, we underestimated the Emperor. "
1045056884825,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE34,"He foresaw the destruction of the empire and took precautions by ensuring the survival of a woman who had been by the emperor's side the longest, someone he trusted implicitly – his most loyal follower."
1045056884826,DIALOGUESCENE282_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE35,The Witch.
1045056884827,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE36,"Only that she wasn't the witch yet. She survived the cleansing by being outside the confinements of the realm and by the time we were aware of her existence, she already struck a bargain with the demon lords."
1045056884828,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE37,"She pledged to serve as their witch, amassing millions of souls on their behalf. In return, they promised to resurrect the emperor, whose soul was in their possession."
1045056884829,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE38,"After this arrangement, she concealed the emperor's body and our sealed sister in a location that eluded even us."
1045056884830,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE39,"For centuries, we've been hunting her, masking it as a simple proxy war. However, on each occasion, she outwitted our chosen Divine Messenger, killing them one after another."
1045056884831,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE40,"Until, at last, you succeeded where everyone before failed."
1045056884832,DIALOGUESCENE282_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE41,Now you know everything.
1045056884833,DIALOGUESCENE283_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"...This was a bit much... I'm not sure I was able to follow everything, but...in essence you are trying to find the sealed goddess.
Then why did you ask for the Emperor's body?"
1045056884834,DIALOGUESCENE283_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE2,"We must never openly disclose our quest for our sister, nor should you ever do so. We believe that there is a substantial probability that the body is concealed in the same location where our sister is hidden."
1045056884835,DIALOGUESCENE283_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE3,"I trust you now comprehend the reasons behind our secrecy. Our destiny, as well as that of all others, hinges on your success in locating the whereabouts of our sister and safeguarding this secret from the Demon Lords."
1045056884836,DIALOGUESCENE283_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Is there nothing you can do?
1045056884837,DIALOGUESCENE283_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE5,"Nothing that would not require us to violate the pact once more, and this time the demon lords will not take another breach quietly. A pact dishonored twice holds no value. War would become an inevitability."
1045056884838,DIALOGUESCENE283_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE6,"No, it must be you. Fulfill this mission on our behalf, and we shall grant you anything within our power. As for you, Divine Messenger, you will be at liberty to pursue your life as you desire, and we will not interfere in the remainder of your existence."
1045056884839,DIALOGUESCENE283_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE7,"However, you must be aware that time is swiftly dwindling. The cultists are on the verge of fullfilling the deal with the demon lords, and the Emperor's revival is imminent."
1045056884840,DIALOGUESCENE283_VOICE OF GHANENTA_DIALOGUE8,"Should he rise up once more, hope that his intentions with our sister do not lead to the demise of us all."
1045056884841,DIALOGUESCENE284_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"<?grayFlash>(Suddenly, a light burst from the god, and just like that, our consciousnesses were back in the temple)"
1045056884842,DIALOGUESCENE284_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,... That was something.
1045056884843,DIALOGUESCENE284_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,I suddenly want another drink.
1045056884844,DIALOGUESCENE284_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Please don't. I don't want to even think about what happens if you accidentally blurt out the 'secret'.
1045056884845,DIALOGUESCENE284_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(*Sighs*. What a mess. It seems we have no other choice but to do what the gods want from us.)
1045056884846,DIALOGUESCENE284_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(We need to find out where the emperor's body is hidden.)
1045056884847,DIALOGUESCENE285_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Where is the Divine Messenger?
1045056884848,DIALOGUESCENE285_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,...She decided to stay inside her room for a while.
1045056884849,DIALOGUESCENE285_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I see...
1045056884850,DIALOGUESCENE285_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Being posessed by the gods really got to her, hasn't it?"
1045056884851,DIALOGUESCENE285_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE5,...
1045056884852,DIALOGUESCENE285_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE6,...She was always aware that her role as the Divine Messenger left her little freedom. 
1045056884853,DIALOGUESCENE285_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE7,"However, to know that she might not even be the master of her own body....I fear the gods are asking too much of her."
1045056884854,DIALOGUESCENE286_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE1,"Take care, Guild Master."
1045056884855,DIALOGUESCENE287_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE1,Guild Master.
1045056884856,DIALOGUESCENE288_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"The question might be a litte late, but what's your name?"
1045056884857,DIALOGUESCENE288_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,"It's Tedric, Guild Master."
1045056884858,DIALOGUESCENE289_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Have you been with the Divine Messenger for long?
1045056884859,DIALOGUESCENE289_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,I've been tasked to protect her ever since she has become the Divine Messenger as a child.
1045056884860,DIALOGUESCENE289_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE3,...I always pitied her.
1045056884861,DIALOGUESCENE289_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE4,A child should be in company of other kids at their age. Not with a bodyguard.
1045056884862,DIALOGUESCENE290_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE1,Anything else?
1045056884863,DIALOGUESCENE291_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE1,"Unfortunately, I don't know the purpose of the capture of the witch either."
1045056884864,DIALOGUESCENE291_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,There is little the Divine Messenger is allowed to relay to me and in this case I don't think even she knew that things would turn out this way.
1045056884865,DIALOGUESCENE291_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"I was afraid of that but well, no harm in asking."
1045056884866,DIALOGUESCENE292_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,{PROTAGONIST}.
1045056884867,DIALOGUESCENE292_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Fiola.
1045056884868,DIALOGUESCENE292_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,"As unbelievable as it might seem, the Guild seems to have improved their reputation a bit since you've taken over."
1045056884869,DIALOGUESCENE292_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"Now that we have the necessary funds, there will be a need to invest those funds into improving the Guild."
1045056884870,DIALOGUESCENE292_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Sound reasonable and therefore slightly uncharacteristic of you.
Did you have anything specific in mind?"
1045056884871,DIALOGUESCENE292_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,I'll send you some drafts. I think some of the others also had their own ideas.
1045056884872,DIALOGUESCENE293_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045056884873,DIALOGUESCENE293_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,...
1045056884874,DIALOGUESCENE293_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>You wanna go ****!
1045056884875,DIALOGUESCENE293_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>Try me!
1045056884876,DIALOGUESCENE293_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,"<?whiteFlash>Whoa, there you two! We're here to greet the new Guild Master. Not to start a fight!"
1045056884877,DIALOGUESCENE293_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...And who are you?
1045056884878,DIALOGUESCENE293_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"Hello, Guild Master! I'm Falken. One of the instructors of the Adventuring Guild."
1045056884879,DIALOGUESCENE293_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,"I was asked by Fiola here to accompany her in this meeting, saying that it would be troublesome if the two of you were alone."
1045056884880,DIALOGUESCENE293_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,But I didn't quite...expect this.
1045056884881,DIALOGUESCENE293_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,{PROTAGONIST} and I share a...history. {PROTAGONIST} was a friend of my late husband but the two of us never saw eye to eye.
1045056884882,DIALOGUESCENE293_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,I was too afraid that your gaze would turn me into stone.
1045056884883,DIALOGUESCENE293_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,And wouldn't that be wonderful? Besides of course from the ugly statue that would spoil the landscape.
1045056884884,DIALOGUESCENE294_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Geez! No need to underline your relationship before me. Don't we actually have more important matters to discuss?
1045061079040,DIALOGUESCENE294_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"For example, welcoming the new Guild Master of the Adventurer Guild! Congratulations!"
1045061079041,DIALOGUESCENE294_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,...
1045061079042,DIALOGUESCENE294_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,Although I have to admit that this won't be an easy position to be in.
1045061079043,DIALOGUESCENE294_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Fran's letter slightly hinted at it. How bad is it?
1045061079044,DIALOGUESCENE294_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,"I don't know how much you have heard but the Adventurer Guild has been going downhill for some time now.
"
1045061079045,DIALOGUESCENE294_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"We lost most of our reputation and contacts. All of our seasoned adventurers have left us and there is not much gold left to keep the Guild going. Honestly, it's a mess."
1045061079046,DIALOGUESCENE294_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...That does sound bad.
1045061079047,DIALOGUESCENE294_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,That's why you're here! The former Guild Master was certain that you can bring the Adventurer Guild back on its feet.
1045061079048,DIALOGUESCENE294_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Where do we start?
1045061079049,DIALOGUESCENE294_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,My suggestion would be to start recruiting new adventurers.
1045061079050,DIALOGUESCENE294_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,You can usually find them in the tavern. How about we pay it a visit right now?
1045061079051,DIALOGUESCENE295_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045061079052,DIALOGUESCENE295_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(Oh great...It's her.)
1045061079053,DIALOGUESCENE296_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,(This is Fiola. My friend's wife.)
1045061079054,DIALOGUESCENE296_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(She and I have an agreement.)
1045061079055,DIALOGUESCENE296_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"(I can't stand her, she can't stand me.)"
1045061079056,DIALOGUESCENE297_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,So you really came back...{PROTAGONIST}.
1045061079057,DIALOGUESCENE297_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Fiola...I see you're still here. I was sure by now that you'd be already back in your swamp hut and brewing some children in an iron cauldron.
1045061079058,DIALOGUESCENE297_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,Charming as ever I see. I guess the only thing that grew older is your exterior.
1045061079059,DIALOGUESCENE297_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"I still can't believe you will become the new Guild Master. What was my husband thinking?<waitfor=0.8>
It's like a nightmare."
1045061079060,DIALOGUESCENE297_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,You can help me get rid of mine by going back to the underworld you call home.
1045061079061,DIALOGUESCENE297_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,"And just leave the Guild, which my husband has spent his life to raise, to somebody who I'm sure has done nothing worthwhile in the last 10 years? 
"
1045061079062,DIALOGUESCENE297_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,I think not.
1045061079063,DIALOGUESCENE298_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045061079064,DIALOGUESCENE298_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(Oh great...It's her.)
1045061079065,DIALOGUESCENE299_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,(This is Fiola. My friend's wife.)
1045061079066,DIALOGUESCENE299_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(She and I have an agreement.)
1045061079067,DIALOGUESCENE299_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"(I can't stand her, she can't stand me.)"
1045061079068,DIALOGUESCENE300_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,So you really came back...{PROTAGONIST}.
1045061079069,DIALOGUESCENE300_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Fiola.
1045061079070,DIALOGUESCENE300_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,<?whiteFlash>Wait!...Where are the adventurers I've sent for you?
1045061079071,DIALOGUESCENE300_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,You really don't want to know.
1045061079072,DIALOGUESCENE300_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,Oh great! You haven't been the Guild Master for even a day and we already lost three adventurers.
1045061079073,DIALOGUESCENE300_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,What was my husband thinking in making you his successor? It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from.
1045061079074,DIALOGUESCENE300_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"How about helping me get rid of mine, by going back to the underworld you call home?"
1045061079075,DIALOGUESCENE300_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,"And just leave the Guild, which my husband has spent his life to raise, to somebody who I'm sure has done nothing worthwhile in the last 10 years?
"
1045061079076,DIALOGUESCENE300_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,I think not.
1045061079077,DIALOGUESCENE301_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>{PROTAGONIST}!
1045061079078,DIALOGUESCENE301_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.
1045061079079,DIALOGUESCENE301_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,There's an army marching towards the Adventurer Guild!
1045061079080,DIALOGUESCENE301_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>WHAT?!
1045061079081,DIALOGUESCENE302_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"Several travelers have seen an odd army consisting of humans, goblins, jotuns, lephoz, and vampires march through the lands."
1045061079082,DIALOGUESCENE302_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,"Considering where they have been spotted in the last several days, it's obvious that they're heading towards us."
1045061079083,DIALOGUESCENE302_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,...It has to be the cult.
1045061079084,DIALOGUESCENE302_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"<?shakeScreen>DAMN IT! That's what he meant!
How did I not see this coming!
"
1045061079085,DIALOGUESCENE302_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,To think that the cultists would have that kind of number...
1045061079086,DIALOGUESCENE302_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,...How long until they arrive here?
1045061079087,DIALOGUESCENE302_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,A few days at most...
1045061079088,DIALOGUESCENE302_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,...How did an army get this close without anyone noticing?
1045061079089,DIALOGUESCENE302_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,"Considering that the cultists were always a diverse group, made up of individuals from different backgrounds and races, it's easy to assume that they hailed from various locations and just recently joined forces."
1045061079090,DIALOGUESCENE302_ASTRID_DIALOGUE10,What about house Greyhorn? Shouldn't they be responding to an army right next to their doorsteps?
1045061079091,DIALOGUESCENE302_ROGUE_DIALOGUE11,"Mobilizing an army could take weeks. And considering that it hasn't been that long since they fought the bandit king, they might even opt to simply wait until they're done with the Guild before they act."
1045061079092,DIALOGUESCENE302_EMILY_DIALOGUE12,"T-they wouldn't, would they?"
1045061079093,DIALOGUESCENE302_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE13,I'm sorry. I once again brought death to this place...
1045061079094,DIALOGUESCENE302_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,"Guild Master?
What should we do?"
1045061079095,DIALOGUESCENE303_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045061079096,DIALOGUESCENE303_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"<?whiteFlash>... Falken.
Please check with the adventurers and see how many of them are willing to stay."
1045061079097,DIALOGUESCENE303_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"<?shakeScreen>You're not planning to fight, are you?"
1045061079098,DIALOGUESCENE303_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...With everyone who is willing to stay behind.
1045061079099,DIALOGUESCENE303_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>That's suicidal! We may have a fortress but not nearly the numbers to actually fend off an army!
1045061079100,DIALOGUESCENE303_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,...We need to abandon the Guild...
1045061079101,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Then we'll lose everything!
1045061079102,DIALOGUESCENE304_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,Guild Master...
1045061079103,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...I won't abandon this place.
Not without a fight."
1045061079104,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I'll ask House Greyhorn for help. Maybe with those who stay behind we can hold out long enough for them to send reinforcement.
1045061079105,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Lily, could you travel to House Greyhorn and plead for us?"
1045061079106,DIALOGUESCENE304_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,"You're sending me away?
<?shakeScreen>I can also fight!"
1045061079107,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Please. You're our best hope in convincing them to help. As Divine Messenger, your words should have some weight."
1045061079108,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"And in the worst-case scenario, you have to continue without us.
You know as well as I do what is on the line."
1045061079109,DIALOGUESCENE304_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE9,...I understand. I'll go immediately and try to come back as soon as possible!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045061079110,DIALOGUESCENE304_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE10,"W-wait, your holiness!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045061079111,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,Everyone. I won't ask any of you to stay. 
1045061079112,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...Truth to be told...I don't want any of you to stay.
1045061079113,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13, I want you to know that... I'm glad to have known you all. And that's why I hope you'll stay safe.
1045061079114,DIALOGUESCENE304_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,That's all. You can all go now.
1045061079115,DIALOGUESCENE305_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,"Now there is still one place you also need to know of.
The temple."
1045061079116,DIALOGUESCENE305_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,Sometimes people will get injured and need only time to heal.
1045061079117,DIALOGUESCENE305_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,But time is a luxury we cannot always afford.
1045061079118,DIALOGUESCENE305_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,Yes...unfortunately.
1045061079119,DIALOGUESCENE305_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,But the temple can help us with that. How about we also give it a visit today?
1045061079120,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,"Hello, Guild Master!"
1045061079121,DIALOGUESCENE306_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Oh, hey Me'can. Is there something you need?"
1045061079122,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE3,"No, no. I just wanted to introduce you to somebody."
1045061079123,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE4,"This here is my buddy, Hopi."
1045061079124,DIALOGUESCENE306_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>!!!
1045061079125,DIALOGUESCENE306_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>That's a Lephoz!
1045061079126,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE7,"Now, now, Guild Master. Don't be rude. His name is Hopi. "
1045061079127,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE8,"His tribe is actually not hostile to humans, and Hopi himself is quite fond of human culture. He's pretty amazing. He even taught himself the human language."
1045061079128,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE9,"Hopi, say hello to the Guild Master."
1045061079129,DIALOGUESCENE306_HOPI_DIALOGUE10,Hello Mis...
1045061079130,DIALOGUESCENE306_HOPI_DIALOGUE11,<?whiteFlash>...?
1045061079131,DIALOGUESCENE306_HOPI_DIALOGUE12,"...Hopi not want be racist but Hopi can not tell if that is miss or mister.
"
1045061079132,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE13,"<?shakeScreen>Hahaha!
It's not you, Hopi. Trust me."
1045061079133,DIALOGUESCENE306_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Could you explain to me why you brought him here?
1045061079134,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE15,"I was just doing a favor for Emily. I told her about this tribe that has been living in these lands for centuries, and that I quite often trade with them on my way here. "
1045061079135,DIALOGUESCENE306_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE16,She was so interested that she asked me to bring one of them over to talk with them.
1045061079136,DIALOGUESCENE306_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"...
<?shakeScreen>EMMILLLY!!!!!"
1045061079137,DIALOGUESCENE307_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,"How great! 
This is the first time I'm actually meeting a Lephoz!"
1045061079138,DIALOGUESCENE307_HOPI_DIALOGUE2,Hopi also excited to meet human. Hopi not get many chances.
1045061079139,DIALOGUESCENE307_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>I have so many questions!
1045061079140,DIALOGUESCENE307_HOPI_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>Hopi too!
1045061079141,DIALOGUESCENE307_EMILY_DIALOGUE5,Alright! Then ask me your questions first!
1045061079142,DIALOGUESCENE307_HOPI_DIALOGUE6,Can Hopi touch your skin? Hopi want know how it feels without hair.
1045061079143,DIALOGUESCENE307_EMILY_DIALOGUE7,Only if I can touch your ears!
1045061079144,DIALOGUESCENE307_HOPI_DIALOGUE8,Hopi agrees!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045061079145,DIALOGUESCENE307_EMILY_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>So fluffy!!
1045061079146,DIALOGUESCENE307_HOPI_DIALOGUE10,So smooth!
1045061079147,DIALOGUESCENE307_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,(They were touching each other and giggled like little kids.)
1045061079148,DIALOGUESCENE307_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Emily... would you explain to me why you asked Me'can to bring a Lephoz here?
1045061079149,DIALOGUESCENE307_EMILY_DIALOGUE13,"Oh, come on, Guild Master! Don't tell me you're not excited to see him here?"
1045061079150,DIALOGUESCENE307_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,I might be more excited if I don't remember every time I see him how I often nearly died of poison in the past.
1045061079151,DIALOGUESCENE307_HOPI_DIALOGUE15,Hopi will not hurt human. Hopi's tribe not hostile to humans.
1045061079152,DIALOGUESCENE307_HOPI_DIALOGUE16,Elder only does not want human near our land.
1045061079153,DIALOGUESCENE307_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"(Yeah. That totally does not sound hostile. 
<?whiteFlash>Wait... how is Me'can able to trade with them?
Ugh... just stop questioning it.)"
1045061079154,DIALOGUESCENE307_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"Emily. Care to answer my question, young lady?"
1045061079155,DIALOGUESCENE308_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,"Alright, alright."
1045061079156,DIALOGUESCENE308_EMILY_DIALOGUE2,"Me'can told me how Hopi's tribe has been living in this area for centuries. So, I've thought that they might know something about the Flower of Eternity. That's why, I asked him if he could let me meet one of them."
1045061079157,DIALOGUESCENE308_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"*Sighs*What a reckless idea.
But fine."
1045061079158,DIALOGUESCENE308_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Hopi, do you know anything about the Flower Of Eternity?"
1045061079159,DIALOGUESCENE308_HOPI_DIALOGUE5,Hopi does not know about Flower Of Eternity.
1045061079160,DIALOGUESCENE308_EMILY_DIALOGUE6,Oh...
1045061079161,DIALOGUESCENE308_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"I'm sorry, Emily."
1045061079162,DIALOGUESCENE308_HOPI_DIALOGUE8,But Elder knows.
1045061079163,DIALOGUESCENE309_EMILY_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash><?shakeScreen>REALLY?!
1045061079164,DIALOGUESCENE309_HOPI_DIALOGUE2,"Yes. Hopi remember when youngling, how elder once said tribe was saved by flower of eternity when plague spread.
"
1045061079165,DIALOGUESCENE309_EMILY_DIALOGUE3,"<?shakeScreen>Guild Master! Did you hear that? Finally a solid lead to the Flower Of Eternity.
We just have to ask their Elder where to find it!"
1045061079166,DIALOGUESCENE309_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...How much does your Elder dislike humans?
1045061079167,DIALOGUESCENE309_HOPI_DIALOGUE5,"...Hopi feel like, human would not like answer."
1045061079168,DIALOGUESCENE309_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Of course.
1045061079169,DIALOGUESCENE309_HOPI_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>But Hopi think Hopi can convince Elder to talk peacefully with human.
1045061079170,DIALOGUESCENE309_EMILY_DIALOGUE8,"<?shakeScreen>Please Guild Master! Can we go? 
Please, please, please!"
1045061079171,DIALOGUESCENE309_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"Alright, but not without some adventurers. I'll be coming too."
1045061079172,DIALOGUESCENE309_EMILY_DIALOGUE10,"<?shakeScreen>YES! Hahaha!
*singing* I'm so close. I'm so close.<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045061079173,DIALOGUESCENE310_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So why are you helping?
What's in it for you?"
1045061079174,DIALOGUESCENE310_HOPI_DIALOGUE2,Hopi like humans. Me'can often bring human wares to tribes. Hopi think that human who able to create wonderful items like those can not be bad.
1045061079175,DIALOGUESCENE310_HOPI_DIALOGUE3,"Hopi hope by helping human, humans also see Hopi not bad. Then maybe Hopi's people and humans one day like each other."
1045061079176,DIALOGUESCENE310_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"...
Now I just feel horrible about myself."
1045061079177,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,"Hello, Guild Master."
1045061079178,DIALOGUESCENE311_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Oh, hello Luana. "
1045061079179,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,...I need your help.
1045061079180,DIALOGUESCENE311_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"<?whiteFlash>My help?
What's the matter?"
1045061079181,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE5,...It's about Rogue... She's acting weird...
1045061079182,DIALOGUESCENE311_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...I have no idea how to respond to that.
1045061079183,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>It's different than usual! 
"
1045061079184,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE8,I can tell... she is planning to leave...
1045061079185,DIALOGUESCENE311_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>Leave? But why?
1045061079186,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE10,I don't know. But she acted like this the last time she... just vanished.
1045061079187,DIALOGUESCENE311_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,Have you tried talking to her?
1045061079188,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE12,It's no use. She pretends that there is nothing wrong.
1045061079189,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE13,"Guild Master, I want to keep an eye on her and hoped you could do so too."
1045061079190,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE14,I-I don't want her to disappear.
1045061079191,DIALOGUESCENE311_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,I'll keep an eye out and ask a few adventurers to do so too.
1045061079192,DIALOGUESCENE311_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,I would also prefer if she doesn't just leave without an explanation.
1045061079193,DIALOGUESCENE311_LUANA_DIALOGUE17,"Thank you, Guild Master!"
1045061079194,DIALOGUESCENE312_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"Oh...hello, Guild Master."
1045061079195,DIALOGUESCENE312_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"...

1045061079196,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>Ouch!
Did you just hit me?"
1045061079197,DIALOGUESCENE313_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>Serves you right for leaving without saying anything!
1045061079198,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,"...I'm sorry.
I-I just discovered that 'they' have learned I was hiding at the Adventurer Guild."
1045065273344,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,I didn't want to put any of you in danger.
1045065273345,DIALOGUESCENE313_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>(Luana hits her!)
1045065273346,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>Ouch! Why is everyone hitting me?!
1045065273347,DIALOGUESCENE313_LUANA_DIALOGUE7,"I always told you that you didn't have to deal with your problems on your own!
<?shakeScreen>Didn't I always tell you that I'd protect you?"
1045065273348,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,Luana...
1045065273349,DIALOGUESCENE313_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"She's right, Rogue. We're also here.
You're part of the Adventurer Guild. If anyone messes with you, then they're messing with us."
1045065273350,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,"...
<?whiteFlash>You know what, Guild Master? You're completely right!"
1045065273351,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE11,"<?shakeScreen>I don't need to be afraid of them anymore! They just lost their precious Executioner!
They'll think twice now before they try to make an enemy out of the Adventurer Guild!"
1045065273352,DIALOGUESCENE313_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,That's the spirit!
1045065273353,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE13,"<?shakeScreen>I'm so not afraid that I'm even going teach the adventurers 'their' most secret techniques! What are they going to do about it?
<?shakeScreen>Nothing!"
1045065273354,DIALOGUESCENE313_ROGUE_DIALOGUE14,<?shakeScreen>You hear me? You can do nothing to me! How do you like that?
1045065273355,DIALOGUESCENE313_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"...Alright, calm down, Rogue.
We <b>don't</b> have to kick the hornet's nest."
1045065273356,DIALOGUESCENE314_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"S-sorry, Guild Master. I got a little bit carried away there."
1045065273357,DIALOGUESCENE314_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,What I want to say is...thank you. For being there for me.
1045065273358,DIALOGUESCENE314_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,"Especially you, Luana."
1045065273359,DIALOGUESCENE314_LUANA_DIALOGUE4,"I promised you that, didn't I?"
1045065273360,DIALOGUESCENE314_LUANA_DIALOGUE5,"Whatever may come, and whatever hardship you might encounter, I always will be there for you."
1045065273361,DIALOGUESCENE314_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045065273362,DIALOGUESCENE314_LUANA_DIALOGUE7,"Is something wrong, Rogue?"
1045065273363,DIALOGUESCENE314_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,I-I need to go now.<?fadeOutNPC>
1045065273364,DIALOGUESCENE314_LUANA_DIALOGUE9,...
1045065273365,DIALOGUESCENE314_LUANA_DIALOGUE10,"I think she's a bit embarrassed.
How cute."
1045065273366,DIALOGUESCENE314_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"Despite not showing her face, she's kinda easy to read, isn't she?"
1045065273367,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045065273368,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,Interesting...not quite my opinion but it does raise some questions...
1045065273369,DIALOGUESCENE315_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...Hi!
1045065273370,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>...
1045065273371,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,"...""Hi""."
1045065273372,DIALOGUESCENE315_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Are you one of the instructors here?
1045065273373,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,Indeed I am.
1045065273374,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,Majika. The mage instructor.
1045065273375,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,Now that I answered your question...
1045065273376,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE10,Goodbye!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045065273377,DIALOGUESCENE315_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,<?shakeScreen>Wait! Don't you want to know who I am?
1045065273378,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,Not particularly. No.
1045065273379,DIALOGUESCENE315_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,I'm the new Guild Master around here!
1045065273380,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE14,We have a new Guild Master?
1045065273381,DIALOGUESCENE315_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,W-wait! Don't you know that Fran has passed away?
1045065273382,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE16,"Oh no, that I do know of. But I've heard that the Guild was not disbanding and that was all the interest I had in that matter."
1045065273383,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE17,But I do admit that a new Guild Master due to the current circumstances does make sense. I hope this doesn't affect my studies...
1045065273384,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE18,"Well, was there anything else you like to say, Guild Master?"
1045065273385,DIALOGUESCENE315_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,I...uh...guess not?
1045065273386,DIALOGUESCENE315_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE20,"Then I'll excuse myself. Good day, Guild Master!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045065273387,DIALOGUESCENE315_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,(...I don't even know anymore...)
1045065273388,DIALOGUESCENE316_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,It seems by following the trails of the expedition we found ourselves in some secret hall filled with guardians. 
1045065273389,DIALOGUESCENE316_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,"They do not seem hostile for now, so let's not attempt anything to agitate them."
1045065273390,DIALOGUESCENE317_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,I've encountered doors like these before. The ancient empyreans called them Gate Guardians.
1045065273391,DIALOGUESCENE317_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,They're magically enhanced doors that only open when given the right password.
1045065273392,DIALOGUESCENE317_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,"Considering that there are no other paths, I can only assume that my son's expedition passed through the door."
1045065273393,DIALOGUESCENE317_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,Could it be that they have got themselves trapped? Possibly...there might be other hidden traps or safety measures we are unaware of.
1045065273394,DIALOGUESCENE317_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,"Adventurers, let us try to pass through the door. For this we need to somehow infer the password required to enter."
1045065273395,DIALOGUESCENE317_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,"If that proves to be impossible, then there is also another way. I've studied these doors enough that I've developed a spell to break their enchantment."
1045065273396,DIALOGUESCENE317_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,"However, it's most likely that the guardians will retaliate if we open the door this way."
1045065273397,DIALOGUESCENE317_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,I leave the manner of approach to you.
1045065273398,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,"Greetings, Guild Master. Thank you for coming."
1045065273399,DIALOGUESCENE318_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Hello Majika.  You wanted to see me?
1045065273400,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,Yes. I'm in need of assistance from the Adventurer Guild.
1045065273401,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,...It's about a personal matter of mine.
1045065273402,DIALOGUESCENE318_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,What is it?
1045065273403,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,It's in regard to my son. He's...missing.
1045065273404,DIALOGUESCENE318_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,<?whiteFlash>!
1045065273405,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,My husband has sent me a message that our son has not returned from an expedition he led into an ancient ruin.
1045065273406,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,Ancient ruins are rife with dangers and I...
1045065273407,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE10,...I fear for him.
1045065273408,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE11,I need to enter those ruins myself and search for my son.
1045065273409,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,"However, I'm not an adventurer and I fear my own abilities will not suffice for such an expedition."
1045065273410,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE13,That's where I require the assistance of the Adventurer Guild.
1045065273411,DIALOGUESCENE318_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Don't worry Majika.
1045065273412,DIALOGUESCENE318_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,You can count on us. We'll help you find your son.
1045065273413,DIALOGUESCENE318_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE16,"You have my gratitude, Guild Master. I hope we're not too late."
1045065273414,DIALOGUESCENE319_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,Hello Guild Master.
1045065273415,DIALOGUESCENE319_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Hi Majika, I wanted to check up on you."
1045065273416,DIALOGUESCENE319_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I heard everything went well in the last quest.
1045065273417,DIALOGUESCENE319_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,"Indeed Guild Master. Thanks to the adventurers you've sent, we successfully found my son and saved him."
1045065273418,DIALOGUESCENE319_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,"Words can not express the gratitude I have for you, Guild Master."
1045065273419,DIALOGUESCENE319_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I'm glad we could help you.
1045065273420,DIALOGUESCENE319_ALLEN_DIALOGUE7,Mother. I'll be leaving.
1045065273421,DIALOGUESCENE319_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?whiteFlash>Oh! Is this...
1045065273422,DIALOGUESCENE319_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,"Guild Master, meet my son, Allen."
1045065273423,DIALOGUESCENE319_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE10,"Allen, this is the Guild Master."
1045065273424,DIALOGUESCENE319_ALLEN_DIALOGUE11,"Greetings, Guild Master. I assume I have you to thank for my timely rescue."
1045065273425,DIALOGUESCENE319_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,You have your mother to thank for that. After all she was the one who was worried enough to ask us for help.
1045065273426,DIALOGUESCENE319_ALLEN_DIALOGUE13,...Is that so? I see.
1045065273427,DIALOGUESCENE319_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...Don't you have anything to say about that?
1045065273428,DIALOGUESCENE319_ALLEN_DIALOGUE15,"...Of course. I'm also grateful to you, mother."
1045065273429,DIALOGUESCENE319_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,That kinda sounded flat.
1045065273430,DIALOGUESCENE319_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE17,"It's fine Guild Master. Considering our relationship, that's enough."
1045065273431,DIALOGUESCENE319_ALLEN_DIALOGUE18,...
1045065273432,DIALOGUESCENE320_SELENE_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Hey! Mama's boy!
1045065273433,DIALOGUESCENE320_ALLEN_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>SELENE!

1045065273437,DIALOGUESCENE320_ALLEN_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>Selene! This is not the best time to discuss this!
1045065273438,DIALOGUESCENE320_SELENE_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>****!
1045065273439,DIALOGUESCENE320_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,...Excuse me but for what reason did you refer to him as 'Mama's boy'?
1045065273440,DIALOGUESCENE320_SELENE_DIALOGUE9,Hmmm? That's because he's one.
1045065273441,DIALOGUESCENE320_ALLEN_DIALOGUE10,Selene....!
1045065273442,DIALOGUESCENE320_SELENE_DIALOGUE11,"He never shuts up about his mother. Always saying stuff like how **** brilliant she is, or that he needs to do better to make her proud."
1045065273443,DIALOGUESCENE320_SELENE_DIALOGUE12,"Even when we were trapped in that **** room, he kept yammering: ""What would mother do?"""
1045065273444,DIALOGUESCENE320_ALLEN_DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreen>SELENE!!!!
1045065273445,DIALOGUESCENE320_SELENE_DIALOGUE14,"Oh, just give it a rest. You love your mother so just own up to it!"
1045065273446,DIALOGUESCENE320_ALLEN_DIALOGUE15,"...Fine.
You can have your bonus."
1045065273447,DIALOGUESCENE320_SELENE_DIALOGUE16,**** yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
1045065273448,DIALOGUESCENE320_ALLEN_DIALOGUE17,<?shakeScreen>AND YOU'RE FIRED!

1045065273452,DIALOGUESCENE321_ALLEN_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen> D-don't misunderstand mother! I respect you as a scholar and your work is obviously outstanding! Anyone with half a mind would tell you that!
1045065273453,DIALOGUESCENE321_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,"...I see. Even then, it's still a relief to me that you don't hate me."
1045065273454,DIALOGUESCENE321_ALLEN_DIALOGUE4,What? O-of course not! Why would you think that?
1045065273455,DIALOGUESCENE321_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,"...I'm well aware of my own shortcomings as a mother. I can not deny that by pursuing my studies, I may have inadvertently harmed our relationship."
1045065273456,DIALOGUESCENE321_ALLEN_DIALOGUE6,No...that's...
1045065273457,DIALOGUESCENE321_ALLEN_DIALOGUE7,...
1045065273458,DIALOGUESCENE321_ALLEN_DIALOGUE8,...Maybe I do sometimes wish we were a little bit closer...
1045065273459,DIALOGUESCENE321_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,...
1045065273460,DIALOGUESCENE321_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...Why not try now?
1045065273461,DIALOGUESCENE321_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"I mean now that all the feelings are out in the open, there is nothing that really prevents you from trying to do better now."
1045065273462,DIALOGUESCENE321_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,"You have a point, Guild Master."
1045065273463,DIALOGUESCENE321_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE13,"Son...would you like to exchange our research notes? I'm quite certain, that there is a myriad of knowledge we both could gain from each other."
1045065273464,DIALOGUESCENE321_ALLEN_DIALOGUE14,I...I'd like that.
1045065273465,DIALOGUESCENE321_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,(All's well that ends well. Or wait! We can do better than that!)
1045065273466,DIALOGUESCENE321_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,"<?shakeScreen>How about you stay with us here, Allen? We surely have some place where you can stay and you both could work on your studies together!"
1045065273467,DIALOGUESCENE321_ALLEN_DIALOGUE17,"My apologies, Guild Master, but I can not do that. I need to return home to my wife and son as soon as possible. I'm sure they're worried sick by now."
1045065273468,DIALOGUESCENE321_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE18,...Your wife and...<b>son</b>?
1045065273469,DIALOGUESCENE321_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE19,I'm...a grand mother?!
1045065273470,DIALOGUESCENE322_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>And you never deemed it necessary, to inform me about it?!"
1045065273471,DIALOGUESCENE322_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(Uh-oh...)
1045065273472,DIALOGUESCENE322_ALLEN_DIALOGUE3,I-I thought father already told you....
1045065273473,DIALOGUESCENE322_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,"I will have a word with him at a later time, you can be assured of that, but do not presume that it implies exoneration on your end ."
1045065273474,DIALOGUESCENE322_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,My failure as a mother has now become apparent with the lack of discipline I seem to have instilled on you.
1045065273475,DIALOGUESCENE322_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,A mistake I intend to rectify.
1045065273476,DIALOGUESCENE322_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Uh...I think I better leave so you two can have some nice mother-and-son bonding time.
1045065273477,DIALOGUESCENE322_ALLEN_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>N-No! <?shakeScreen>Guild Master!
1045065273478,DIALOGUESCENE322_ALLEN_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>PLEASE WAAAAAIT!!!!!!
1045065273479,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,...
1045065273480,DIALOGUESCENE323_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,This is our supplier.
1045065273481,DIALOGUESCENE323_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...
1045065273482,DIALOGUESCENE323_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,His name is Me'can. A name I'm pretty sure is made up.
1045065273483,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE5,It certainly is!
1045065273484,DIALOGUESCENE323_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...I see we're already off to a great start.
1045065273485,DIALOGUESCENE323_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Care to explain?
1045065273486,DIALOGUESCENE323_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,...After the Guild has started to lose its reputation fewer and fewer merchants were willing to do business with us.
1045065273487,DIALOGUESCENE323_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,Then suddenly a very suspicious stranger appeared...
1045065273488,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE10,That would be me!
1045065273489,DIALOGUESCENE323_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,...and he offered to become our supplier now that all the other merchants have cut their contact with us.
1045065273490,DIALOGUESCENE323_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,"He never showed us his face, never told us where he came from or why he even wants to support the Adventurer Guild..."
1045065273491,DIALOGUESCENE323_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,So all the red flags.
1045065273492,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE14,"Buuut beggars can't be choosers. And you my dear customers, are very much beggars right now and I'm the philanthropist who is holding you up."
1045065273493,DIALOGUESCENE323_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,So you're doing this out of generosity?
1045065273494,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE16,"Oh, nonononono! The actual reason is completely different from that."
1045065273495,DIALOGUESCENE323_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,And you're not going to tell us.
1045065273496,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE18,Exactly! You're just as insightful as you look!
1045065273497,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE19,"I mean even if I told you a reason, how could you possibly know I'm telling the truth?"
1045065273498,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE20,"For all you know, I could be a big bad evil guy and this is all part of an unnecessarily elaborate plan to destroy everything you love and care about."
1045065273499,DIALOGUESCENE323_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,...
1045065273500,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE22,"Lighten up, Guild Master! I'm joking of course!"
1045065273501,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE23,*Sighs*. I miss the old Guild Master. He actually laughed when I told him that.
1045065273502,DIALOGUESCENE323_FIOLA_DIALOGUE24,"...Despite all of...<b>that</b>, there was never any problem with the wares Me'can brought to us. Quite the opposite in fact. "
1045069467648,DIALOGUESCENE323_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE25,I guess we have no choice but to keep on relying on you then...
1045069467649,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE26,"Thank you, Guild Master! You will not regret this."
1045069467650,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE27,<?whiteFlash>...Or will you?
1045069467651,DIALOGUESCENE323_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE28,<?shakeScreen>Just kidding! Hahahaha!
1045069467652,DIALOGUESCENE324_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Did you have any troubles with bandits lately?
1045069467653,DIALOGUESCENE324_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE2,"I'm moved that you're worried about me, Guild Master,  but there is no need to. "
1045069467654,DIALOGUESCENE324_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE3,Bandits have never posed a problem for me.
1045069467655,DIALOGUESCENE324_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...
1045069467656,DIALOGUESCENE324_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...How?
1045069467657,DIALOGUESCENE324_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I've never seen you travel with any guards and your cart isn't small enough to travel...covertly.
1045069467658,DIALOGUESCENE324_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE7,I have my ways. So you don't have to worry about any shipments coming too late.
1045069467659,DIALOGUESCENE324_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Are you going to tell me how you do it?
1045069467660,DIALOGUESCENE324_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE9,No.
1045069467661,DIALOGUESCENE324_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...
1045069467662,DIALOGUESCENE324_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE11,Good talking to you Guild Master!
1045069467663,DIALOGUESCENE325_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,"My, my. The bandit king surely sounds like a dangerous fellow. With the way things are, many merchants would probably be too afraid to travel to do trade."
1045069467664,DIALOGUESCENE325_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE2,But not me! Aren't you glad to have me as a trading partner?
1045069467665,DIALOGUESCENE325_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I probably still preferred to have a merchant I can look in the eyes.
1045069467666,DIALOGUESCENE325_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE4,You'd have a hard time with your two eyes and my six.
1045069467667,DIALOGUESCENE325_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045069467668,DIALOGUESCENE325_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>Hahahaha! You should have seen your face!
1045069467669,DIALOGUESCENE326_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,To think the Divine Messenger herself will be visiting you.
1045069467670,DIALOGUESCENE326_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE2,I just take my eyes away from you for just a second and suddenly the Guild is all grown up.
1045069467671,DIALOGUESCENE326_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE3,I wonder if this is what a mother bird feels when she sees her baby bird fly for the first time.
1045069467672,DIALOGUESCENE326_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,What do you think about the Divine Messenger herself?
1045069467673,DIALOGUESCENE326_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE5,I think she probably has the worst job in the world.
1045069467674,DIALOGUESCENE326_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,How so?
1045069467675,DIALOGUESCENE326_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE7,They say that the gods are like the parents of mankind.
1045069467676,DIALOGUESCENE326_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE8,Now imagine your parents watching your every move and telling their opinion on everything you do.
1045069467677,DIALOGUESCENE326_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...That does sound hellish...
1045069467678,DIALOGUESCENE326_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE10,"If those priests are actually right with their sermons, then the gods will probably have a lot to nag about."
1045069467679,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,Yes...I remember that day.
1045069467680,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE2,"I wasn't here exactly when it happened. I arrived in the morning the next day, when it was already over."
1045069467681,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE3,...It wasn't a pretty sight. 
1045069467682,DIALOGUESCENE327_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"You know, now that I know that has happened, your suspiciousness has become just more threatening to me."
1045069467683,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE5,If you think I'm in cahoots with the people who attacked the Guild then you're mistaken.
1045069467684,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE6,But I know that just saying that probably won't ease your worries.
1045069467685,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE7,"In that case, if you ever have the slightest doubt about me..."
1045069467686,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE8,<?whiteFlash>Then you can cut me down right where I stand.
1045069467687,DIALOGUESCENE327_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...I have my doubts now.
1045069467688,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE10,Then will you kill me now?
1045069467689,DIALOGUESCENE327_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,No...
1045069467690,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE12,"Thank you, Guild Master."
1045069467691,DIALOGUESCENE327_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,You're quite the mystery to me Me'can. Why would you go so far?
1045069467692,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE14,"You might not believe me Guild Master, but I have great respect for the Adventurer Guild and I would do anything to help you."
1045069467693,DIALOGUESCENE327_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,You mean even giving us a discount on the wares?
1045069467694,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE16,...
1045069467695,DIALOGUESCENE327_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE17,I think I might have phrased that wrong.
1045069467696,DIALOGUESCENE328_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,"I always knew you had in ya to beat the witch and her cult.
But surely it isn't over yet."
1045069467697,DIALOGUESCENE328_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Why would you think that?
1045069467698,DIALOGUESCENE328_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE3,"Well, it would be quite disappointing if it were, wouldn't it? And life isn't as boring as that."
1045069467699,DIALOGUESCENE329_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,Hello Guild Master! How I can be of service?
1045069467700,DIALOGUESCENE330_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So how old are you?
1045069467701,DIALOGUESCENE330_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE2,After 2 millennia I stopped counting.
1045069467702,DIALOGUESCENE330_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,What is your real name?
1045069467703,DIALOGUESCENE330_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE4,It's a word that can not be pronounced in any known language.
1045069467704,DIALOGUESCENE330_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Are you human?
1045069467705,DIALOGUESCENE330_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE6,"If I were, would I be wearing all these clothes that cover up my skin?"
1045069467706,DIALOGUESCENE330_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Was any of that remotely true?
1045069467707,DIALOGUESCENE330_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE8,No.
1045069467708,DIALOGUESCENE330_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...
1045069467709,DIALOGUESCENE330_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE10,Good Talking to you Guild Master!
1045069467710,DIALOGUESCENE331_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,"As always, it has been a pleasure!"
1045069467711,DIALOGUESCENE332_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,"Anything else you'd like to say, Guild Master?"
1045069467712,DIALOGUESCENE333_ME'CAN_DIALOGUE1,Guild Master! Anything I can Interest in you in?

I wanted to ask you a favor."
1045069467757,DIALOGUESCENE338_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What's the favor?
1045069467758,DIALOGUESCENE338_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"I'm planning on a trip to a grave and because there have been some rumors of bandits, I was hoping that some adventurers could escort me there."
1045069467759,DIALOGUESCENE338_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,A trip to a grave? You mean...
1045069467760,DIALOGUESCENE338_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,"Yes, Guild Master.
My daughter's grave."
1045069467761,DIALOGUESCENE338_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"I understand.
I'll arrange for some adventurers to accompany you. "
1045069467762,DIALOGUESCENE338_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"And if it's acceptable, I'd also like to join.
Even though I never had the chance to know her, I'd like to pay my respects."
1045069467763,DIALOGUESCENE338_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,"Of course Guild Master.
And thank you!"

1045069467765,DIALOGUESCENE338_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,<?shakeScreen>N-Nora?!
1045069467766,DIALOGUESCENE338_NORA_DIALOGUE11,"I know you might not want me there, but I would like to visit Mily one last time."
1045069467767,DIALOGUESCENE338_NORA_DIALOGUE12,...before I leave forever.
1045069467768,DIALOGUESCENE338_EDEN_DIALOGUE13,...
1045069467769,DIALOGUESCENE338_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Eden?
1045069467770,DIALOGUESCENE338_EDEN_DIALOGUE15,"...Of course. There is nothing wrong with that.
...You can come with us, Nora."
1045069467771,DIALOGUESCENE338_NORA_DIALOGUE16,Thank you.
1045069467772,DIALOGUESCENE339_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,"It's good to see you, Guild Master."
1045069467773,DIALOGUESCENE339_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Hi Eden.
I wanted to see how things are between you and Nora after what happened last time."
1045069467774,DIALOGUESCENE339_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"You do not need to worry about it. I meant what I said when I promised to do better. 
I will not try to push her away anymore."
1045069467775,DIALOGUESCENE339_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Does that mean...
1045069467776,DIALOGUESCENE339_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,I've told my acquaintance that Nora will be staying here after all.
1045069467777,DIALOGUESCENE339_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I'm glad that things worked out between you two.
1045069467778,DIALOGUESCENE339_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"I'm glad too. Although, there is still that awkwardness between us.
I guess years of growing apart aren't filled that easily."
1045069467779,DIALOGUESCENE339_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,"Today for example, I caught her several times tailing me, as if she wants to say something but is hesitant to do so."
1045069467780,DIALOGUESCENE339_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,"Isn't that right, Nora?"
1045069467781,DIALOGUESCENE339_NORA_DIALOGUE10,"<?whiteFlash>Iieeps! S-sorry Mr. Eden.
"
1045069467782,DIALOGUESCENE339_NORA_DIALOGUE11,I just didn't want to bother you.
1045069467783,DIALOGUESCENE340_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,"It's alright. You don't have to worry.
Bother me as much as you like."
1045069467784,DIALOGUESCENE340_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,"There is something you want to say, isn't there?"
1045069467785,DIALOGUESCENE340_NORA_DIALOGUE3,"<?shakeScreen>Y-yes, Mr. Eden!
I-I...wanted to ask you..."

1045069467793,DIALOGUESCENE341_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(No one needs to know mine did too.)
1045069467794,DIALOGUESCENE341_NORA_DIALOGUE6,Does that mean...

You can call me Papa, if you like."
1045069467796,DIALOGUESCENE341_NORA_DIALOGUE8,Thank you...Papa!

1045069467798,DIALOGUESCENE341_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Maybe you should ease into it until he's used to it.
1045069467799,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE1,...H-Hi...
1045069467800,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE2,"Y-you're the Guild Master, right?"
1045069467801,DIALOGUESCENE342_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...And you are?
1045069467802,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE4,M-my name is Misasa and I-I...
1045069467803,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>I-I'd like to join the Adventurer Guild!
1045069467804,DIALOGUESCENE342_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Misasa...Where did I hear that name?
1045069467805,DIALOGUESCENE342_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,<?whiteFlash>Wait! Are you that bandit girl the adventurers met at the bandit king's fortress?
1045073661952,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE8,"<?shakeScreen> Y-Yikes! Y-yes, that's me."
1045073661953,DIALOGUESCENE342_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,And now you want to be an adventurer? Why?
1045073661954,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE10,I-I don't have anywhere else to go...
1045073661955,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE11,"I'm useless on my own. I-I know nothing. 
I-I'm too afraid to live out there on my own."
1045073661956,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE12,Y-your adventurers were nice enough to let me go...I thought m-maybe this was a good place to join.
1045073661957,DIALOGUESCENE342_MISASA_DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreen>P-please Guild Master! I know I might not deserve a second chance b-but can you overlook my past and let me join you?
1045073661958,DIALOGUESCENE343_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...Fine you can join.
1045073661959,DIALOGUESCENE343_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It might be better than letting you go and risk having you join another bandit group.
1045073661960,DIALOGUESCENE343_MISASA_DIALOGUE3,"T-thank you, Guild Master! You will not regret it!"
1045073661961,DIALOGUESCENE343_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,You better hope so.
1045073661962,DIALOGUESCENE344_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I can not let you join. Adventurers need to be able to trust each other.
1045073661963,DIALOGUESCENE344_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,I can not trust you. Consider yourself lucky enough that we let you go.
1045073661964,DIALOGUESCENE344_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Not every bandit is as lucky as you.
1045073661965,DIALOGUESCENE344_MISASA_DIALOGUE4,I-I...I understand...
1045073661966,DIALOGUESCENE344_MISASA_DIALOGUE5,F-for what it's worth...I'm sorry.
1045073661967,DIALOGUESCENE344_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I'm not the one you need to apologize to.
1045073661968,DIALOGUESCENE344_MISASA_DIALOGUE7,...<?fadeOutNPC>
1045073661969,DIALOGUESCENE345_MISASA_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>G-Guild Master! 
I-I need to ask you a favor!"
1045073661970,DIALOGUESCENE345_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Did you get swindled out of your money again?
1045073661971,DIALOGUESCENE345_MISASA_DIALOGUE3,"N-No! It's not that!
I-I just heard the Divine Messenger is here in the Guild."
1045073661972,DIALOGUESCENE345_MISASA_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>C-Could you ask her how to get rid of my Mark?!
1045073661973,DIALOGUESCENE345_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Oh, right...your mark. The one you got, when you were with the Bandit King."
1045073661974,DIALOGUESCENE345_MISASA_DIALOGUE6,"I-I'm scared, Guild Master.
Knowing that my soul belongs to demons when I die..."
1045073661975,DIALOGUESCENE345_MISASA_DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>C-Can you please ask her of a way to get rid of it!? 
<?shakeScreen>I'd do anything! 
Anything!"
1045073661976,DIALOGUESCENE345_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"Calm down, Misasa!
I will ask her...for your sake."
1045073661977,DIALOGUESCENE345_MISASA_DIALOGUE9,"T-thank you, Guild Master."
1045073661978,DIALOGUESCENE346_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,You wanted to see me?
1045073661979,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,"That's right, Guild Master. Thank you for coming."
1045073661980,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,I was hoping I could ask you a...personal favor.
1045073661981,DIALOGUESCENE346_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Depends on the favor.
1045073661982,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,Then let me start from the beginning.
1045073661983,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,"A few days ago, some travellers have been talking about an old wandering Paladin, travelling the roads fighting monsters and bandits alike."
1045073661984,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"From their description, I think I know that man and I would like you to find him for me."
1045073661985,DIALOGUESCENE346_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...Does he owe you money?
1045073661986,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>...What? No!
1045073661987,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,He's an old aquaintance of mine. A good man.
1045073661988,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,Maybe too good.
1045073661989,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE12,"As long as I've known him, he travelled the lands with the sole purpose of helping people in need."
1045073661990,DIALOGUESCENE346_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,That sounds like a good thing.
1045073661991,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE14,It might have been 20 years ago.
1045073661992,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE15,Now I'm only worried that he might get himself killed one day if he continues like that.
1045073661993,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE16,Honestly he was already at an advanced age when I first met him.
1045073661994,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE17,In the past I've asked him many times if he wouldn't consider to just retire and try to live a peaceful life.
1045073661995,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE18,But that man can be stubborn as a mule.
1045073661996,DIALOGUESCENE346_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,"So, you want me to send some adventurers to find him and persuade him to retire?"
1045073661997,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE20,<?whiteFlash>I was actually hoping if we could offer him a place in the Guild as an instructor.
1045073661998,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE21,"If we can convince him that the Guild is a place that helps people, then he might be persuaded to share his wisdom with adventurers."
1045073661999,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE22,This would keep the man out of harm's way and the Guild would gain access to the years of experiences of a paladin.
1045073662000,DIALOGUESCENE346_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,I like the sound of that. I'll see what I can do.
1045073662001,DIALOGUESCENE346_EDEN_DIALOGUE24,"That's all I'm asking. Thank you, Guild Master! "
1045073662002,DIALOGUESCENE347_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,"*pant*, *pant*"
1045073662003,DIALOGUESCENE347_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>TAKE THIS!
1045073662004,DIALOGUESCENE347_BAI_DIALOGUE3,"*Spit*. <?whiteFlash>You call that a punch, you wuss?"
1045073662005,DIALOGUESCENE347_BAI_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>THIS IS A PUNCH!
1045073662006,DIALOGUESCENE347_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,Ugh.......*thud*<?fadeOutNPC>
1045073662007,DIALOGUESCENE347_BYSTANDER A_DIALOGUE6,She beat another one!
1045073662008,DIALOGUESCENE347_BYSTANDER B_DIALOGUE7,That's five consecutive wins! Who is she?
1045073662009,DIALOGUESCENE347_BYSTANDER C_DIALOGUE8,That's not important! She won again! That means...
1045073662010,DIALOGUESCENE347_BAI_DIALOGUE9,"You know the drill, you drunken bastards!"
1045073662011,DIALOGUESCENE347_BAI_DIALOGUE10,Another round of beer for everyone and five for me on this loser's tab! 
1045073662012,DIALOGUESCENE347_ALL BYSTANDERS_DIALOGUE11,Cheers!!!
1045073662013,DIALOGUESCENE348_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,What is happening here?
1045073662014,DIALOGUESCENE348_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,"We've gotten ourselves a very 'lively' visitor, Guild Master."
1045073662015,DIALOGUESCENE348_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,She appeared this morning and the first thing she asked for was a drink. 
1045073662016,DIALOGUESCENE348_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,But apparently she is travelling without money and couldn't afford to buy a drink.
1045073662017,DIALOGUESCENE348_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,"So she started challenging people to fist fights and they always make the same bet. If she manages to beat them, they have to pay a round of beer for everyone and..."
1045073662018,DIALOGUESCENE348_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...five for her. I heard it. And what's in for them? What do they get when they win?
1045073662019,DIALOGUESCENE348_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,"Oh, they get nothing. They just want to beat her. "
1045073662020,DIALOGUESCENE348_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...What?
1045073662021,DIALOGUESCENE348_TAVI_DIALOGUE9,Believe me. That girl has a really nasty mouth.
1045073662022,DIALOGUESCENE348_BAI_DIALOGUE10,Tavi! Where is the booze? I'm starting to sober up here!
1045073662023,DIALOGUESCENE348_TAVI_DIALOGUE11,"Yeah, yeah. 
I'll be right back."
1045073662024,DIALOGUESCENE348_BAI_DIALOGUE12,"I love you, Tavi!"
1045073662025,DIALOGUESCENE349_BAI_DIALOGUE1,...
1045073662026,DIALOGUESCENE349_BAI_DIALOGUE2,...Hmmm...
1045073662027,DIALOGUESCENE349_BAI_DIALOGUE3,<?whiteFlash>*touch*
1045073662028,DIALOGUESCENE350_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>W-What the hell! Why would you touch me there!
1045073662029,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE2,I was just curious if you're a guy or a gal. 
1045073662030,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE3,"Who are you, mysterious being?"
1045073662031,DIALOGUESCENE350_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...The name is {PROTAGONIST}. I'm the Guild master of the Adventurer Guild. 
1045073662032,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE5,A master? Does that mean you're strong?
1045073662033,DIALOGUESCENE350_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Not necessarily...
1045073662034,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE7,Booohhh! Boring! I call you master of nothing then!
1045073662035,DIALOGUESCENE350_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,(Now I'm starting to get why people get into fights with her.)
1045073662036,DIALOGUESCENE350_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"...So, what's your name?"
1045073662037,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE10,"The name's Bai. Master and rightful heir to the martial arts style ""Broken Fist""."
1045073662038,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE11,"Wait, that doesn't sound right. Was it maybe ""Breaking Fist""? Nah, still sounds stupid."
1045073662039,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE12,"Aren't usually animals in those names? ""Tiger Fist"", maybe? Ugh, sounds ridiculous. Tigers don't even have fists."
1045073662040,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE13,"""Fists of the East Star""? ""Water Fist""? ""Rock Fist""?....."
1045073662041,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE14,"Argh...whatever! A martial art named by some stupid ancestor of mine. One, I use to beat the crap out of people."
1045073662042,DIALOGUESCENE350_BAI_DIALOGUE15,"From now on, I just call it the ""My Fist in your face""-Style!"
1045073662043,DIALOGUESCENE350_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,...At least that name is self-explanatory.
1045073662044,DIALOGUESCENE351_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,And what exactly brings you around here?
1045073662045,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE2,"Just travelling around, trying to find some students."
1045073662046,DIALOGUESCENE351_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Students?
1045073662047,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE4,"Yeah, students. My old man kept whining at home how I should go out and spread our martial arts to the world."
1045073662048,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE5,Pretty sure it was just a pretense and he just wanted his daughter who was stronger than him out of the house.
1045073662049,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE6,"That man just can't stand not being on top of the food chain.
How pathetic! Hahahaha!"
1045073662050,DIALOGUESCENE351_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Martial arts...huh....
Would you consider teaching it to our adventurers?"
1045073662051,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE8,...Maybe...if they're strong. I don't like teaching weaklings.
1045073662052,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE9,Send one of them against me in a fight and I'll judge if they're good enough.
1045073662053,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE10,They can use their equipments and magic or whatever and I give myself a handicap.
1045073662054,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE11,"If they manage to beat me like that, then I won't mind teaching them."
1045073662055,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE12,"If they don't, then they're free to try as many times as they like. I won't be going anywere for a while."
1045073662056,DIALOGUESCENE351_BAI_DIALOGUE13,I like the booze here and there are enough chumps to beat the money out of.
1045073662057,DIALOGUESCENE351_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,(I better hurry then. Some of those chumps might end up being one of my adventurers.)
1045073662058,DIALOGUESCENE351_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,(I'll set up a quest.)
1045073662059,DIALOGUESCENE352_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,"I'm back! Here are all five rounds at once. I thought this might be faster, seeing as how fast you can empty a mug."
1045073662060,DIALOGUESCENE352_BAI_DIALOGUE2,"You're the best, Tavi!"
1045073662061,DIALOGUESCENE352_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...Wait...Five rounds of beer and this is the fifth time...
1045073662062,DIALOGUESCENE352_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,That liver of hers is the most terrifying thing about her...
1045073662063,DIALOGUESCENE353_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, what do you think?"
1045073662064,DIALOGUESCENE353_BAI_DIALOGUE2,It was a damn good fight! Your adventurers are tougher than most bastards I beat up. I might wanna get serious next time.
1045073662065,DIALOGUESCENE353_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"So, does that mean you agree to teach them?"
1045073662066,DIALOGUESCENE353_BAI_DIALOGUE4,"You can bet your flat ass, I'm going to teach them. "
1045073662067,DIALOGUESCENE353_BAI_DIALOGUE5,"I and  ""My Fist in Your Face""-Style are at your disposal."
1045073662068,DIALOGUESCENE353_BAI_DIALOGUE6,I hope you will be paying my drinks from now on.
1045073662069,DIALOGUESCENE353_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"...I'm going to go broke, aren't I?"
1045073662070,DIALOGUESCENE353_BAI_DIALOGUE8,Bwahahahaha!
1045073662071,DIALOGUESCENE354_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, what do you think about this piece of ore the adventurers brought back home?"
1045073662072,DIALOGUESCENE354_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,It's... fascinating. I've never seen this type of ore before.
1045073662073,DIALOGUESCENE354_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,"It looks similar to mithril... but from what I can tell, it might even surpass it in terms of material quality."
1045073662074,DIALOGUESCENE354_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Do you think you can make anything out of it?
1045073662075,DIALOGUESCENE354_BARRET_DIALOGUE5,I might... but I'll need more of it.
1045073662076,DIALOGUESCENE354_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,That will most likely be difficult. I don't think these things grow on trees. But I'll tell the adventurers to keep an eye out for more of these.
1045073662077,DIALOGUESCENE354_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,I'm kinda excited to see what you might be able to make out of it.
1045073662078,DIALOGUESCENE354_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,...I admit that I'm looking forward to the challenge myself.
1045073662079,DIALOGUESCENE355_NORA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045073662080,DIALOGUESCENE355_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>...Nora?
1045073662081,DIALOGUESCENE355_NORA_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>Guild Master!?
1045073662082,DIALOGUESCENE355_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Is everything alright?
1045073662083,DIALOGUESCENE355_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,You seem down...
1045073662084,DIALOGUESCENE355_NORA_DIALOGUE6,...
1045073662085,DIALOGUESCENE355_NORA_DIALOGUE7,"<?whiteFlash>I-I'm fine, Guild Master!"
1045073662086,DIALOGUESCENE355_NORA_DIALOGUE8,I-I was just resting here but I probably should get back to doing my duties.
1045073662087,DIALOGUESCENE355_NORA_DIALOGUE9,"Have a nice day, Guild Master!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045073662088,DIALOGUESCENE355_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...
1045073662089,DIALOGUESCENE355_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,(I should talk with Eden.)
1045073662090,DIALOGUESCENE356_NORA_DIALOGUE1,...
1045073662091,DIALOGUESCENE356_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>Hello.
1045073662092,DIALOGUESCENE356_NORA_DIALOGUE3,Oh! Hello Guild Master!
1045073662093,DIALOGUESCENE356_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Your name was Nora if I remember correctly.
1045073662094,DIALOGUESCENE356_NORA_DIALOGUE5,"Yes, Guild Master. That's right. 
I'm Priest Eden's acolyte. I support him with all his tasks."
1045073662095,DIALOGUESCENE356_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"So, what are you doing out here?
It seems like you're waiting for something."
1045073662096,DIALOGUESCENE356_NORA_DIALOGUE7,A message is supposed to arrive today for Priest Eden from the church. I'm waiting here for the courier to receive it.
1045073662097,DIALOGUESCENE356_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Really? That's what you're doing? I feel like Eden could do that himself.
1045073662098,DIALOGUESCENE356_NORA_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>O-of course not! He's a very busy man! These kind of tasks are perfect for acolytes like me.
1045073662099,DIALOGUESCENE356_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,But isn't this kind of task rather...dull?
1045073662100,DIALOGUESCENE356_NORA_DIALOGUE11,It doesn't matter! I'm happy to help priest Eden wherever I can.
1045073662101,DIALOGUESCENE356_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"(Well, isn't this adorable.)"
1045073662102,DIALOGUESCENE357_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>I got a message here for the Priest.
1045073662103,DIALOGUESCENE357_NORA_DIALOGUE2,Ah! Thank you! I will take it.
1045073662104,DIALOGUESCENE357_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,Alright! Then with this my task is over. Goodbye!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045073662105,DIALOGUESCENE357_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"Oh, hello Guild Master! It's good to see you.
Did you need something from me?"
1045073662106,DIALOGUESCENE357_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Hello Eden. No, I was just walking by. But Nora here has something for you."
1045073662107,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>...Nora?...
1045073662108,DIALOGUESCENE358_NORA_DIALOGUE2,P-Priest Eden! I-I received a message for you! Here!
1045073662109,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,...I wasn't expecting a message for today...
1045073662110,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"Nora...did you purposely not tell me about it, so I couldn't receive it myself?"
1045073662111,DIALOGUESCENE358_NORA_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>W-what? N-No. I-I...
1045073662112,DIALOGUESCENE358_NORA_DIALOGUE6,"...Yes...I'm sorry.
I-I thought I could do it for you."
1045073662113,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"...It's fine...I'll take it.
Was there anything else Nora?"
1045073662114,DIALOGUESCENE358_NORA_DIALOGUE8,"N-no...
I'll excuse myself."
1045077856256,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,...Nora...
1045077856257,DIALOGUESCENE358_NORA_DIALOGUE10,<?shakeScreen>Y-yes?
1045077856258,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,You don't have to do this. I don't need your help.
1045077856259,DIALOGUESCENE358_NORA_DIALOGUE12,...

1045077856263,DIALOGUESCENE358_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,...Eden?
1045077856264,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE17,<?whiteFlash> Oh! I apologize Guild Master!
1045077856265,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE18,It seems like I'm a little bit tired. I hope you don't mind if I excuse myself for today?
1045077856266,DIALOGUESCENE358_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,Of course not...
1045077856267,DIALOGUESCENE358_EDEN_DIALOGUE20,"Thank you, Guild Master. <?fadeOutNPC>"
1045077856268,DIALOGUESCENE358_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,...
1045077856269,DIALOGUESCENE359_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,Hello Guild Master! I wanted to tell you that Zoldak has arrived.
1045077856270,DIALOGUESCENE359_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Zoldak?
1045077856271,DIALOGUESCENE359_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,The Paladin I've talked to you about. My aquaintance?
1045077856272,DIALOGUESCENE359_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Oh, the one our adventurers has recently helped out."
1045077856273,DIALOGUESCENE359_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,That's right Guild Master! And I'm happy to say that he wants to meet you!
1045077856274,DIALOGUESCENE359_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,It seems like he wants to join the Guild. Just like we hoped for.
1045077856275,DIALOGUESCENE359_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"I guess that's good to hear. So, where is he?"
1045077856276,DIALOGUESCENE359_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,"He's there. He's actually coming towards us, right now."
1045077856277,DIALOGUESCENE359_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,Look at the enthusiasm. He is actually sprinting towards us!
1045077856278,DIALOGUESCENE359_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,He's gaining so much speed that he has to take out his sword.
1045077856279,DIALOGUESCENE359_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,Wait...that doesn't make any sense...
1045077856280,DIALOGUESCENE360_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>Die, Demon!"
1045077856281,DIALOGUESCENE360_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>W-what the hell?
1045077856282,DIALOGUESCENE360_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>I will cast you back into the depths of hell!
1045077856283,DIALOGUESCENE360_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>Be careful where you swing that sword!
1045077856284,DIALOGUESCENE360_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Zoldak! What are you doing?
1045077856285,DIALOGUESCENE360_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>What does it look like I'm doing? I'm banishing a demon!
1045077856286,DIALOGUESCENE360_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>The Guild Master isn't a demon!
1045077856287,DIALOGUESCENE360_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE8,"Don't be deceived, boy! Look at that creature!"
1045077856288,DIALOGUESCENE360_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE9,It's apparent that this is some kind of androgynous succubus! 
1045077856289,DIALOGUESCENE360_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE10,<?shakeScreen>Look at it! You can't tell what is what!
1045077856290,DIALOGUESCENE360_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,...
1045077856291,DIALOGUESCENE360_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE12,Now take this! HOLY SMITE!
1045077856292,DIALOGUESCENE360_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,W-WAIT!!!
1045077856293,DIALOGUESCENE360_EDEN_DIALOGUE14,<?shakeScreen><?whiteFlash>ZOLDAK!!!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045077856294,DIALOGUESCENE361_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,(After a while.)
1045077856295,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,"I'm truly ashamed of myself, Guild Master."
1045077856296,DIALOGUESCENE362_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(That took so much effort to explain.)
1045077856297,DIALOGUESCENE362_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"I'm very sorry about this, Guild Master. Sometimes Zoldak can be quite overzealous."
1045077856298,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>I will accept any punishment you might deem necessary!
1045077856299,DIALOGUESCENE362_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,It's fine!
1045077856300,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE6,"You're far too kind, Guild Master. Very well! I will forego food and drinks for the next two days."
1045077856301,DIALOGUESCENE362_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...Please don't...
1045077856302,DIALOGUESCENE362_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,"How about you tell the Guild Master, why you're here Zoldak."
1045077856303,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>Ah that's right!
1045077856304,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE10,I wish to join the Adventurers Guild as an instructor! 
1045077856305,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE11,"I was moved by the actions of your adventurers, who risked their lives to eradicate the evil, that was plaguing a village."
1045077856306,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE12,"I'm convinced that by joining the Adventurers Guild I can raise a new generation of Paladins, that will join in our unending war against evil!"
1045077856307,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreen>We will raise an army of Paladins! An unending tide that will block the sun! Enough to invade even hell itself!
1045077856308,DIALOGUESCENE362_EDEN_DIALOGUE14,...
1045077856309,DIALOGUESCENE362_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"...I'll just pretend you just said something completely reasonable in the end and welcome you to the Guild, Zoldak."
1045077856310,DIALOGUESCENE362_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE16,"Thank you very much, Guild Master!"
1045077856311,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045077856312,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>!!!
1045077856313,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(What the...?)
1045077856314,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>Ouch! Careful Guild Master!
1045077856315,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,"You should really watch where you're going, Guild Master!"
1045077856316,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Eden? What were you doing crawling on the ground?
1045077856317,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,I was looking for my pendant.
1045077856318,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,I think I lost it here somewhere but I have a hard time looking for it.
1045077856319,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,My eyes aren't what they used to be.
1045077856320,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Is that why you're squinting half the time?
1045077856321,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,I am?
1045077856322,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,I thought you knew.
1045077856323,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE13,"<?shakeScreen>No, of course not!"
1045077856324,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE14,Why didn't anyone tell me?
1045077856325,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,I guess we all just thought that it was just part of your character.
1045077856326,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE16,<?shakeScreen>How is that part of my character?
1045077856327,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,...I have no answer for that.
1045077856328,DIALOGUESCENE363_EDEN_DIALOGUE18,"*Sighs* Anyway,...can you help me look for my pendant? I'm confident that it's around here somewhere."
1045077856329,DIALOGUESCENE363_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,Sure.
1045077856330,DIALOGUESCENE364_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045077856331,DIALOGUESCENE364_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...
1045077856332,DIALOGUESCENE365_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045077856333,DIALOGUESCENE365_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"I think I found it, Eden!"
1045077856334,DIALOGUESCENE365_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"Great! Thanks, Guild Master! Can you bring it to me?"
1045077856335,DIALOGUESCENE365_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Sure.
1045077856336,DIALOGUESCENE366_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>(A picture of a girl...)
1045077856337,DIALOGUESCENE366_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(She looks awfully similiar to Nora.)
1045077856338,DIALOGUESCENE367_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,"Thank you, Guild Master."
1045077856339,DIALOGUESCENE367_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"No problem, Eden."
1045077856340,DIALOGUESCENE367_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...About the girl in the picture...
1045077856341,DIALOGUESCENE367_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"...You saw it, huh?"
1045077856342,DIALOGUESCENE367_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I didn't mean to pry.
1045077856343,DIALOGUESCENE367_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,"No, it's alright. I don't mind telling you."
1045077856344,DIALOGUESCENE367_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,The girl in the picture is my daughter.
1045077856345,DIALOGUESCENE367_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,She...passed away a long time ago.
1045077856346,DIALOGUESCENE367_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...I'm sorry about that.
1045077856347,DIALOGUESCENE367_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,"...
It's alright."
1045077856348,DIALOGUESCENE367_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,I like to believe she is in a better place now.
1045077856349,DIALOGUESCENE367_EDEN_DIALOGUE12,I...I only wished I had more time with her.
1045077856350,DIALOGUESCENE368_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Have you heard of the rise in banditry?
1045077856351,DIALOGUESCENE368_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,"I did. More often than not, some travellers who arrived at the Guild injured by bandit attacks have been brought to us."
1045077856352,DIALOGUESCENE368_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,It's rather worrisome how seemingly common being attacked by bandits has become.
1045077856353,DIALOGUESCENE368_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,I hope we are just experiencing an unusual situation and things will eventually go back to normal.
1045077856354,DIALOGUESCENE368_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Although in normal times, there were still a lot of banditry."
1045077856355,DIALOGUESCENE368_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,"A rather sad thought, isn't it?"
1045077856356,DIALOGUESCENE369_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,I dread the time that will come now with the existence of a bandit king. Bandits have always been a source of suffering for the people but I'm afraid with a bandit king it could become much worse.
1045077856357,DIALOGUESCENE369_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It might be not for long. I heard they're raising an army to deal with him.
1045077856358,DIALOGUESCENE369_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,Then I pray that they'll be successful. 
1045077856359,DIALOGUESCENE370_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,The Divine Messenger is maybe the most important figure in the Church of the Divines.
1045077856360,DIALOGUESCENE370_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,It was the right decision for you to oblige her.
1045077856361,DIALOGUESCENE370_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Although, after hearing what has happened, I'm not necessarily happy about it."
1045077856362,DIALOGUESCENE370_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"I understand, Guild Master. The way the Divine Messenger has handled the situation, has left much to be desired."
1045077856363,DIALOGUESCENE370_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Do you think the gods just used us?
1045077856364,DIALOGUESCENE370_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,Our branch of the church follows the teaching of Ghanenta. He has taught us to show compassion to those around us.
1045077856365,DIALOGUESCENE370_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"I believe if anyone had objections to the way the Guild was treated, it would have been him."
1045077856366,DIALOGUESCENE370_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,I wish I had your faith.
1045077856367,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,It was the worst night of the Adventurer Guild. 
1045077856368,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,Who would have thought that the people closest to us would betray us like that.
1045077856369,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"I was praying in the temple when it started. Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of battle, mixed with screams of wounded people."
1045077856370,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"When I went outside, people were already fighting with each other."
1045077856371,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,Many times  I've seen adventurers argue and fight with each over trivial matters but I knew this was different.
1045077856372,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,We started to fortify the temple against attackers and carried wounded people inside to heal them. We didn't care which side they belonged to.
1045077856373,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,The only thing that mattered that night was to save as many lives as possible.
1045077856374,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,But...there were so many we couldn't save. 
1045077856375,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,The attackers used some sort of curse on their weapons. Making it impossible to use healing magic to stabilize the wounded.
1045077856376,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,So many lives slipped through my fingers that night.
1045077856377,DIALOGUESCENE371_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,When the night was finally over we had lost more adventurers in one night than all the years of the Guild combined.
1045077856378,DIALOGUESCENE371_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...
1045077856379,DIALOGUESCENE372_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,"I wonder for what reasons the gods had us imprison the witch. Usually, they're not that...involved."
1045077856380,DIALOGUESCENE372_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Do you have any inkling why?
1045077856381,DIALOGUESCENE372_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"I'm not the Divine Messenger, so I would be even less qualified to make a guess on their intentions but...I can only imagine something big is happening."
1045077856382,DIALOGUESCENE372_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I don't like the sound of that...
1045077856383,DIALOGUESCENE373_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,How long have you been part of the Adventurers Guild now?
1045077856384,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,I'd say about 8 years now.
1045077856385,DIALOGUESCENE373_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Why did you join?
1045077856386,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,Because I believe in the good the Adventurer Guild can do.
1045077856387,DIALOGUESCENE373_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,What a strange thing to say about adventurers.
1045077856388,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,I used to feel the same. But I still remember the day the former Guild Master came to us and asked for our help.
1045077856389,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,Adventurers never had a good reputation in the church. They were only known as people who'd do anything for money and sometimes were as big of a problem as bandits and monsters.
1045077856390,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,But the former Guild Master seemed different. He told us about his Adventurer Guild. How he wanted it to be something that could help people.
1045077856391,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,He believed that the Guild could provide help to the common people in a time where more and more people resort to banditry and monsters roam unhindered into human territory.
1045077856392,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,He also believed that the Guild could also provide a chance for adventurers to be more than what they were currently known for. 
1045077856393,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,Honestly to us it sounded more like he wanted to create a Guild for heroes. 
1045077856394,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE12,It sounded so unbelievable and many at that time had their doubts.
1045077856395,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE13,But not me.
1045077856396,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE14,I don't know what it was but what he said resonated with me that day and I volunteered to join the Adventurer Guild as representative.
1045077856397,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE15,"Unfortunately, not many of my brothers and sisters followed me. They doubt that a Guild of adventurers could ever do any good."
1045077856398,DIALOGUESCENE373_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,Seeing the State of the current Guild maybe the doubters were right.
1045077856399,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE17,I disagree Guild Master.
1045077856400,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE18,Maybe the Guild has declined but remember that before that it has done what it has promised to do.
1045077856401,DIALOGUESCENE373_EDEN_DIALOGUE19,In these eight years I have seen adventurers do more good and protect more lives than anyone would have expected from them.
1045077856402,DIALOGUESCENE373_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,...
1045077856403,DIALOGUESCENE374_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Eden. There is something I need to talk with you about.
1045077856404,DIALOGUESCENE374_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,I'm here to listen Guild Master.
1045077856405,DIALOGUESCENE375_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,(After a short explanation.)
1045077856406,DIALOGUESCENE376_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,...
1045077856407,DIALOGUESCENE376_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,What happened to the girl is a tragedy.
1045077856408,DIALOGUESCENE376_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,Losing one's family...
1045077856409,DIALOGUESCENE376_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,That's why I wanted to know if there is anything you can do for her.
1045077856410,DIALOGUESCENE376_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Or specifically what the church of Ghanenta can do for her.
1045077856411,DIALOGUESCENE376_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"I heard that they more often than not, help people who lost their livelihoods or families."
1045077856412,DIALOGUESCENE376_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"That's certainly true. Ghanenta has taught us that we have to offer a helping hand to those in need. If she wishes so, we can take her in and help her start a new life somewhere peaceful."
1045077856413,DIALOGUESCENE376_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,I see. That's good to know.
1045077856414,DIALOGUESCENE376_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,(I should talk to the merchant's daughter about this. She should still be in the tavern.)
1045077856415,DIALOGUESCENE377_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,"How can I help, Guild Master?"
1045077856416,DIALOGUESCENE378_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I just saw Nora outside.
1045077856417,DIALOGUESCENE378_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,She seemed...down. Do you know why?
1045082050560,DIALOGUESCENE378_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,...I asked her to become an acolyte for an aquaintance of mine. A priestess in Ravenreach.
1045082050561,DIALOGUESCENE378_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,She will have a spot open in a few months and I thought that Nora would fit well with her.
1045082050562,DIALOGUESCENE378_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Ravenreach? That's pretty far away from here.
1045082050563,DIALOGUESCENE378_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,"...
That's the intention."
1045082050564,DIALOGUESCENE378_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,That sounds like you want to send her away.
1045082050565,DIALOGUESCENE378_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,The priestess in Ravenreach is a kind person. She'll take good care of Nora.
1045082050566,DIALOGUESCENE378_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,...In my presence she will just continue to suffer.
1045082050567,DIALOGUESCENE378_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"...Alright, that's it!  I've tried to stay out of your personal affairs, but I have to ask now."
1045082050568,DIALOGUESCENE378_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,What happened between you two? Why are you treating her so coldly?
1045082050569,DIALOGUESCENE378_EDEN_DIALOGUE12,...
1045082050570,DIALOGUESCENE378_EDEN_DIALOGUE13,How about we continue this conversation somewhere else?
1045082050571,DIALOGUESCENE379_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Why are we sitting in the confession booth?
1045082050572,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,It just felt appropriate.
1045082050573,DIALOGUESCENE379_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...
1045082050574,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"...It started about 8 years ago, just shortly after I joined the Adventurer Guild."
1045082050575,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,"Some adventurers returned with a little girl, they found on their Quest."
1045082050576,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,That was the first time I met Nora.
1045082050577,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"She was in shock, barely responsive, having lost her parents in a monster attack. She would have perished too if not for the adventurers."
1045082050578,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,"Fran, the former Guild Master, thought it was best to send her to an orphanage but decided to let her stay with the Guild for a while until she felt better."
1045082050579,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,"...I volunteered to take care of her since I was already raising a daughter of my own within the Guild, and I thought it would provide the best environment for her."
1045082050580,DIALOGUESCENE379_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Your daughter was also at the Guild?
1045082050581,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,Yes.
1045082050582,DIALOGUESCENE379_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,And her mother?
1045082050583,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE13,Long gone...
1045082050584,DIALOGUESCENE379_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...
1045082050585,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE15,"Nora started to live with us. She was initially quiet, hardly responding to anything."
1045082050586,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE16,"If it had been just me, I don't know if she would have ever smiled again."
1045082050587,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE17,"But my daughter, Mily, she spoke to Nora every day. "
1045082050588,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE18,"Maybe it was because they were about the same age, but slowly, Nora started opening up to her."
1045082050589,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE19,It didn't take long for her to act and laugh like a child should.
1045082050590,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE20,"...A wonderful few years passed, where we spent our time together like a family. Very often their laughter would fill the temple and it was like I had two daughters."
1045082050591,DIALOGUESCENE379_EDEN_DIALOGUE21,No one even thought about sending her to an orphanage anymore.
1045082050592,DIALOGUESCENE379_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,...What happened then?
1045082050593,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,...One day both of them sneaked out of the Adventurer Guild.  When we realized they disappeared we frantically tried to search for them.
1045082050594,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,"I eventually found Nora, standing close to a cliff, staring blankly into the chasm."
1045082050595,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,I pulled her away and asked her where Mily was.
1045082050596,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"...She broke in tears, saying that it was all her fault."
1045082050597,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,Saying that it was her idea to sneak out of the Guild.
1045082050598,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,Saying that she only wanted to collect flowers as a present for me.
1045082050599,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"...I asked her again where my daughter was, knowing full well the answer that was awaiting me."
1045082050600,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,...
1045082050601,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,In tears she pointed at the chasm in front of us...
1045082050602,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,...It took days until we finally found her body.
1045082050603,DIALOGUESCENE380_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,...
1045082050604,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,...Did you know that Nora is dying her hair? Green isn't her natural hair color.
1045082050605,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,"She became my acolyte, a position that my daughter aspired to be, and tried to support me in any way she could."
1045082050606,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,"...I believe she is trying to become the daughter I lost as penance.
"
1045082050607,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,I tried telling her that I don't blame her but I think I hurt her just more with my words.
1045082050608,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,"...They weren't true, after all."
1045082050609,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,"...So, I stopped saying it."
1045082050610,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,...
1045082050611,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,Guild Master...Can I confess my sin to you?
1045082050612,DIALOGUESCENE381_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"...What is it, Eden?"
1045082050613,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,...My sin is that I'm unable to forgive an innocent girl who never meant any harm.
1045082050614,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,That I let her quietly suffer for three years without saying anything.
1045082050615,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE12,That the best I can do is to send her away so I stop tormenting her.
1045082050616,DIALOGUESCENE381_EDEN_DIALOGUE13,...Do you think my sin can be forgiven?
1045082050617,DIALOGUESCENE382_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,...Neither do I.
1045082050618,DIALOGUESCENE383_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,Then you're much kinder than I could ever be.
1045082050619,DIALOGUESCENE384_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So about your acolyte Nora.
1045082050620,DIALOGUESCENE384_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,...
1045082050621,DIALOGUESCENE384_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,...What about her?
1045082050622,DIALOGUESCENE384_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I was just wondering what kind of relationship you two have.
1045082050623,DIALOGUESCENE384_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,It seemed like she really holds you in high regard. 
1045082050624,DIALOGUESCENE384_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,"She is my acolyte in name only. Nothing more, nothing less."
1045082050625,DIALOGUESCENE384_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,A position I didn't want her to have in the first place.
1045082050626,DIALOGUESCENE384_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Then why let her become your acolyte?
1045082050627,DIALOGUESCENE384_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,...I didn't have the heart to refuse her...
1045082050628,DIALOGUESCENE384_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,What do you me...
1045082050629,DIALOGUESCENE384_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,<?whiteFlash>Guild Master.
1045082050630,DIALOGUESCENE384_EDEN_DIALOGUE12,"Please, could you let it rest?
I...I do not want to talk about it."
1045082050631,DIALOGUESCENE384_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,...I understand. I won't pry any further.
1045082050632,DIALOGUESCENE384_EDEN_DIALOGUE14,"Thank you, Guild Master."
1045082050633,DIALOGUESCENE385_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, how are things, 'Papa'?"
1045082050634,DIALOGUESCENE385_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,"Please, don't make fun of me, Guild Master. I can't help how I react to it."
1045082050635,DIALOGUESCENE385_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,You have no idea how it is to hear those words again after so many years.
1045082050636,DIALOGUESCENE385_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"But you're happy to hear them, aren't you?"
1045082050637,DIALOGUESCENE385_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,"I can't deny that.
I don't really deserve it after how I treated her all these years."
1045082050638,DIALOGUESCENE385_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,But I will try my best to earn it.
1045082050639,DIALOGUESCENE385_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,Maybe I should buy her a small doll as a present.
1045082050640,DIALOGUESCENE385_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...I think she might be too old for that.
1045082050641,DIALOGUESCENE385_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,Really? But she is still so little.
1045082050642,DIALOGUESCENE385_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,She is old enough that some of the younger adventurers are already showing interest in her.
1045082050643,DIALOGUESCENE385_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,"Oh...do they? Could you tell me their names?
I'd be happy to learn more about them..."
1045082050644,DIALOGUESCENE385_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,(Oh crap. He went full daddy-mode.)
1045082050645,DIALOGUESCENE386_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,"May Ghanenta bless you, Guild Master."
1045082050646,DIALOGUESCENE387_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,How else can I help?

1045082050706,DIALOGUESCENE393_NORA_DIALOGUE3,H-Have you ever fought bandits before?
1045082050707,DIALOGUESCENE393_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,More often than not.
1045082050708,DIALOGUESCENE393_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,People usually assume that fighting monsters is harder than bandits but that's not always the case.
1045082050709,DIALOGUESCENE393_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Sometimes humans can be a lot scarier than monsters.
1045082050710,DIALOGUESCENE394_NORA_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>A-a bandit King?
Shouldn't we do something?"
1045082050711,DIALOGUESCENE394_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"We're already doing something. We take care of the Quests, where bandits might cause trouble."
1045082050712,DIALOGUESCENE394_NORA_DIALOGUE3,I-I mean s-shouldn't we send some adventurers to defeat the bandit king?
1045082050713,DIALOGUESCENE394_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"I think there are better people out there that can do that instead of us. For example, house Greyhorn is already preparing to take care of it."
1045082050714,DIALOGUESCENE394_NORA_DIALOGUE5,"I see...Hopefully, they'll be successful."
1045082050715,DIALOGUESCENE394_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"It'll be fine.
...Surely."
1045082050716,DIALOGUESCENE395_NORA_DIALOGUE1,T-The Divine Messenger is returning?
1045082050717,DIALOGUESCENE395_NORA_DIALOGUE2,I-I see...
1045082050718,DIALOGUESCENE395_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,You don't seem very happy about that.
1045082050719,DIALOGUESCENE395_NORA_DIALOGUE4,...I'm scared of what might happen....
1045082050720,DIALOGUESCENE395_NORA_DIALOGUE5,Last time things didn't go well....
1045082050721,DIALOGUESCENE396_NORA_DIALOGUE1,That night I was still awake. I watched Mr. Eden pray and was worried that he might stay up all night.
1045082050722,DIALOGUESCENE396_NORA_DIALOGUE2,And out of nowhere suddenly people could be heard fighting. Mr. Eden went outside to see what happened and returned with a grim expression on his face.
1045086244864,DIALOGUESCENE396_NORA_DIALOGUE3,He woke everybody in the temple and together we barricaded most of the entrances to the temple. Mr. Eden told everyone to stay inside until the situtation outside has resolved.
1045086244865,DIALOGUESCENE396_NORA_DIALOGUE4,"But...despite what he told everyone else, he himself went outside and carried back any wounded he could find."
1045086244866,DIALOGUESCENE396_NORA_DIALOGUE5,H-he tried to save as many as he could. He looked so desperate at that time...
1045086244867,DIALOGUESCENE396_NORA_DIALOGUE6,...and I felt so useless.
1045086244868,DIALOGUESCENE396_NORA_DIALOGUE7,I could do nothing for anyone.
1045086244869,DIALOGUESCENE396_NORA_DIALOGUE8,We buried so many people the next day...
1045086244870,DIALOGUESCENE397_NORA_DIALOGUE1,I don't understand why anyone would become the servant of the demon lords.
1045086244871,DIALOGUESCENE397_NORA_DIALOGUE2,Why did she kill all those people?
1045086244872,DIALOGUESCENE397_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,That's what I intend to find out.
1045086244873,DIALOGUESCENE398_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, what exactly is your relationship with Eden?"
1045086244874,DIALOGUESCENE398_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"You seem...very fond of him.
(Do I need to worry here?)"
1045086244875,DIALOGUESCENE398_NORA_DIALOGUE3,"...After I lost my parents and was brought to the Guild, it was actually Mr. Eden who started to take care of me."
1045086244876,DIALOGUESCENE398_NORA_DIALOGUE4,He's like a father to me. He was always so kind to me. He never even yelled at me when I misbehaved.
1045086244877,DIALOGUESCENE398_NORA_DIALOGUE5,"All I remember is his smile,  him patting my head and telling me that everything is going to be alright..."
1045086244878,DIALOGUESCENE398_NORA_DIALOGUE6,...
1045086244879,DIALOGUESCENE398_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...And then I guess something happened between you two.
1045086244880,DIALOGUESCENE398_NORA_DIALOGUE8,...
1045086244881,DIALOGUESCENE398_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"(Looking at her, it seems like she doesn't want to continue. I should leave it at that.)"
1045086244882,DIALOGUESCENE399_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, how did you come to join the Adventurer Guild?"
1045086244883,DIALOGUESCENE399_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Did the church send you to become Eden's acolyte?
1045086244884,DIALOGUESCENE399_NORA_DIALOGUE3,N-no. I...I actually only became part of the church when I decided to become Mr. Eden's acolyte.
1045086244885,DIALOGUESCENE399_NORA_DIALOGUE4,Before that...I was just an orphan.
1045086244886,DIALOGUESCENE399_NORA_DIALOGUE5,"I lost my parents when I was still a little child. I...I don't remember much, but we were attacked by monsters when we were travelling."
1045086244887,DIALOGUESCENE399_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...How did you survive?
1045086244888,DIALOGUESCENE399_NORA_DIALOGUE7,...Some adventurers appeared and killed the monsters. They saved me...but my parents weren't as lucky.
1045086244889,DIALOGUESCENE399_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...I'm sorry to hear that.
1045086244890,DIALOGUESCENE399_NORA_DIALOGUE9,"I-it's fine, Guild Master. It happened a long time ago. I'm sure my parents are in a better place now."
1045086244891,DIALOGUESCENE399_NORA_DIALOGUE10,After what happened the adventurers took me with them. It turned out they were adventurers from the Adventurer Guild.
1045086244892,DIALOGUESCENE399_NORA_DIALOGUE11,It was since then that I started living here.
1045086244893,DIALOGUESCENE399_NORA_DIALOGUE12,It was also the time when Mr. Eden joined the Adventurer Guild...
1045086244894,DIALOGUESCENE400_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So, how are things between you and Eden?"
1045086244895,DIALOGUESCENE400_NORA_DIALOGUE2,It's great! We're nearly as close as we used to be! 
1045086244896,DIALOGUESCENE400_NORA_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>We even eat at the same table again!
1045086244897,DIALOGUESCENE400_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"That really means a lot to you, doesn't it?"
1045086244898,DIALOGUESCENE400_NORA_DIALOGUE5,I was always worried that I might have completely destroyed my relationship with Papa.
1045086244899,DIALOGUESCENE400_NORA_DIALOGUE6,"When we sat together as a family—Mily, Papa, and me—it was one of my happiest memories."
1045086244900,DIALOGUESCENE400_NORA_DIALOGUE7,I-I just wanted to have a slice of that back.
1045086244901,DIALOGUESCENE400_NORA_DIALOGUE8,"<?whiteFlash>I-Is everything alright, Guild Master?"
1045086244902,DIALOGUESCENE400_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,I...just had something in my eyes.
1045086244903,DIALOGUESCENE401_NORA_DIALOGUE1,"G-Ghanenta bless you, Guild Master!"
1045086244904,DIALOGUESCENE402_NORA_DIALOGUE1,H-Hello Guild Master! You wanted to talk to me?
1045086244905,DIALOGUESCENE403_NORA_DIALOGUE1,A-anything else I can do for you?
1045086244906,DIALOGUESCENE404_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,{PROTAGONIST}.

You look more uptight than usual. How come?"
1045086244908,DIALOGUESCENE404_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,"Spare me your humor!
We have more important matters!"
1045086244909,DIALOGUESCENE404_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>We received an urgent Quest from a nearby village!
1045086244910,DIALOGUESCENE404_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...How urgent?
1045086244911,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,They're in danger of getting raided by bandits.
1045086244912,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>!!!
1045086244913,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,They say that bandits showed up and declared that the <b>Bandit King</b> is demanding a tribute from them.
1045086244914,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,(A Bandit King? I guess we got our reason why the bandits have been acting up lately.)
1045086244915,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,They were ready to pay the bandits whatever they wanted......but instead of money they wanted half their people.
1045086244916,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>They wanted actual people?
1045086244917,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,Yes.
1045086244918,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...For what purpose?
1045086244919,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,I don't know but the bandits threatened to destroy the village if they don't have the people ready the next time they return.
1045086244920,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,Of course the villagers do not want to meet their demands and are desperate. They asked us to protect them.
1045086244921,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,What about  the local lord? Shouldn't he be protecting them?
1045086244922,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,I heard house Greyhorn is preparing a subjugation force against the bandits.
1045086244923,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,But they won't spare any men for the protection of the village.
1045086244924,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...
1045086244925,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE15,"...The bandits will probably come in great number, I...I'm not sure if our adventurers are at the level where they could handle that."
1045086244926,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE16,You're the Guild Master. What shall we do?
1045086244927,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,...<?whiteFlash>We accept the Quest.
1045086244928,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"This is actually an opportunity for us. Lately our name hasn't been spreading as much with the usual Quests we're getting.  
"
1045086244929,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,But saving a village could really help us spread our fame.
1045086244930,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE20,"If we fail, then it might be really the end of us."
1045086244931,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,"I never said it wasn't a gamble. But without any risks, we won't achieve anything."
1045086244932,DIALOGUESCENE405_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,"And besides...
I don't think Fran would be very happy if we just turn our back on the villagers."
1045086244933,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE23,...
1045086244934,DIALOGUESCENE405_FIOLA_DIALOGUE24,I put up the Quest. Send the adventurers whenever you think they're ready.
1045086244935,DIALOGUESCENE406_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,Good. You found a group that is willing to work with you. Congratulations!
1045086244936,DIALOGUESCENE406_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It's much easier than having to deal with you. So what's next?
1045086244937,DIALOGUESCENE406_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"Now that we have the adventurers, we should be able to do Quests again."
1045086244938,DIALOGUESCENE406_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"But before we send the adventurers on their first Quest for the Adventurer Guild, we should make some preparations."
1045086244939,DIALOGUESCENE406_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,"Usually, the Guild provides the adventurers with items for their adventures. A few potions, bandages, antidotes and etc."
1045086244940,DIALOGUESCENE406_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,"Unfortunately, the Guild currently has nothing in their inventory."
1045086244941,DIALOGUESCENE406_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,And where do we get more?
1045086244942,DIALOGUESCENE406_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,"We still have a merchant here, who is selling us his supplies. But he is a bit..."
1045086244943,DIALOGUESCENE406_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,...well it doesn't matter. You'll see for yourself.
1045086244944,DIALOGUESCENE406_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,(...I don't like how that sounds.)
1045086244945,DIALOGUESCENE406_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,"Well, I guess it's time for you to meet Me'can."
1045086244946,DIALOGUESCENE407_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Now we should have everything ready for the adventurers to start their first official quest for the Adventurer Guild.
1045086244947,DIALOGUESCENE407_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,"For now the Quests we get, aren't much."
1045086244948,DIALOGUESCENE407_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,"But hopefully, when our reputation starts to get better there will be more and better paying quests available."
1045086244949,DIALOGUESCENE407_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"From here on out, the future of the Adventurer Guild is in your hands."
1045086244950,DIALOGUESCENE407_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,...
1045086244951,DIALOGUESCENE407_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,Don't screw this up!
1045086244952,DIALOGUESCENE408_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045086244953,DIALOGUESCENE408_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,<?grayFlash><?shakeScreen>Guild Master!
1045086244954,DIALOGUESCENE408_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>Ah shit!
1045086244955,DIALOGUESCENE408_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreenWeak>Don't just appear out of nowhere! I nearly had an heart attack!
1045086244956,DIALOGUESCENE408_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,"I'm sorry Guild Master, but I need to talk with you."
1045086244957,DIALOGUESCENE408_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,It's important...
1045086244958,DIALOGUESCENE408_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...Alright. I have time. What do you need to talk about?
1045086244959,DIALOGUESCENE408_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,Not here. It isn't safe. Let's change location!
1045086244960,DIALOGUESCENE408_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,Here! Wear this blindfold.
1045086244961,DIALOGUESCENE408_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...Is this really necessary?
1045086244962,DIALOGUESCENE408_ROGUE_DIALOGUE11,"If you do not want to wake up with your throat slit open one day, then yes. It's necessary."
1045086244963,DIALOGUESCENE408_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,*sigh*. Fine...
1045086244964,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045086244965,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...Are we there yet?
1045086244966,DIALOGUESCENE409_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,A little while longer.
1045086244967,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...
1045086244968,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Do we really need to crawl here or are you just trying to throw me off?
1045086244969,DIALOGUESCENE409_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,Maybe.
1045086244970,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...
1045086244971,DIALOGUESCENE409_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,We're here. 
1045086244972,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...
1045086244973,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,This place is completely dark...
1045086244974,DIALOGUESCENE409_ROGUE_DIALOGUE11,That's on purpose.
1045086244975,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"So, I'm not even allowed to know what the place, where we're talking, looks like?"
1045086244976,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"A place, I like to add, I have no idea how to get to."
1045086244977,DIALOGUESCENE409_ROGUE_DIALOGUE14,"Believe me. It's safer this way, Guild Master!"
1045086244978,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"Fine, I'll take your word for that."
1045086244979,DIALOGUESCENE409_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,"So, what is it that you wanted to talk with me about?"
1045086244980,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,...This is hard for me to ask of you...
1045086244981,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,...But I need your help.
1045086244982,DIALOGUESCENE410_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...For what?
1045086244983,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,"...A friend of mine...is being pursued by ""them""."
1045086244984,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,"...I don't know how this has happened. I tried to leave no connections to her but somehow ""they"" still found out."
1045086244985,DIALOGUESCENE410_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Knowing you it's hard to imagine that you let something slip by.
1045086244986,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,...In the end it doesn't matter how. All I know is that my friend needs my help and I have to go.
1045086244987,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,"My friend has gone into hiding and ""they"" were able to locate two possible hideouts where she might be."
1045086244988,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,This is where I need your help. I need some adventurers to check one of the locations while I check the other.
1045086244989,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,"We need to get there before ""they"" and bring my friend to safety."
1045086244990,DIALOGUESCENE410_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,...
1045086244991,DIALOGUESCENE410_ROGUE_DIALOGUE12,I know it's a lot to ask for and I'd rather not get you involved against a powerful enemy but...
1045086244992,DIALOGUESCENE410_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Powerful enemy?
1045086244993,DIALOGUESCENE411_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,As if I could get scared of something you refuse to talk about.
1045086244994,DIALOGUESCENE411_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"All I heard is that your friend needs help against some people who want to harm them. 
Sounds like a normal Quest to me."
1045086244995,DIALOGUESCENE411_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,Guild Master...
1045086244996,DIALOGUESCENE411_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I'll put up a Quest on the board and we'll get to it as soon as possible.
1045086244997,DIALOGUESCENE411_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,"Thank you, Guild Master!"
1045086244998,DIALOGUESCENE411_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Now...
1045086244999,DIALOGUESCENE411_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,How do I get back?
1045086245000,DIALOGUESCENE411_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,...
1045086245001,DIALOGUESCENE411_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"Oh right, the blindfold."
1045086245002,DIALOGUESCENE412_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,"Damn it! Now, we're getting attacked by wild monsters!"
1045086245003,DIALOGUESCENE412_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Beware of that dire wolf. It's a quick fellow and I reckon that at your level you will have a hard time hitting it.
1045086245004,DIALOGUESCENE412_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,Do you have any tips?
1045086245005,DIALOGUESCENE412_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"I do! 
<?whiteFlash>Believe in yourself!"
1045086245006,DIALOGUESCENE412_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,...Any other tips?
1045086245007,DIALOGUESCENE412_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I'm being serious. I've seen you fight! You're all stronger than you think you are!
1045086245008,DIALOGUESCENE412_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE7,R-really?
1045086245009,DIALOGUESCENE412_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"Yes! I've hardly seen anyone as talented as you lot!
Now go out there! I'm sure you'll be able to defeat those monsters!"

1045086245019,DIALOGUESCENE413_SELENE_DIALOGUE7,"So, how much does being an adventurer here pay?"
1045086245020,DIALOGUESCENE413_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...Fairly.

1045086245024,DIALOGUESCENE413_SELENE_DIALOGUE12,I'm currently looking for a new job since...
1045086245025,DIALOGUESCENE413_SELENE_DIALOGUE13,"...my last jerk of a boss, couldn't take some ***** teasing."
1045090439168,DIALOGUESCENE413_SELENE_DIALOGUE14,How about it? Want to have a kick-ass priestess in your team?
1045090439169,DIALOGUESCENE413_SELENE_DIALOGUE15,I'm the best at keeping people alive and also pretty good at ***** people up when they're down.
1045090439170,DIALOGUESCENE413_SELENE_DIALOGUE16,"Especially, when they're down...fu,fu,fu."
1045090439171,DIALOGUESCENE414_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Sure. Why not? We could always use a healer in our midst.

1045090439209,DIALOGUESCENE424_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Gods, that man was even more agitated than usual. He nearly bit me!"
1045090439210,DIALOGUESCENE424_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,What happened for him to...act even crazier than usual?
1045090439211,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,...It has something to do with the message I received from the church just recently.
1045090439212,DIALOGUESCENE425_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What kind of message?
1045090439213,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,They asked me to relay the message that they want to initiate a quest with the Adventurer Guild.
1045090439214,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,Are you familiar with the necromancer named Edmund Galthagin?
1045090439215,DIALOGUESCENE425_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"I hope that I recall wrong, but isn't that the necromancer who has actually achieved lichdom?"
1045090439216,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,"The very one. 
For decades the church has been trying to hunt him down and exterminate him, but unfortunately, every attempt was in vain. "
1045090439217,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"We could only watch helplessly as he continued causing death and destruction, devouring souls to sustain his form."
1045090439218,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,"Just recently, the church has discovered his latest hideout in an old fortress. This time they want to enlist the Adventurer Guild, hoping for a better chance of success."
1045090439219,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,"Zoldak, the fool, immediately decided that he had to confront the lich all on his own."
1045090439220,DIALOGUESCENE425_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"I see. I guess this does sound like something that would upset Zoldak, but usually he would leave it to us."
1045090439221,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,"... I think this might be more personal. I already told you that the church tried to exterminate the lich several times, didn't I?"
1045090439222,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE12,"...Zoldak was sent on one of those times. 
He and several other paladins were sent to go after Edmund, but in the end only Zoldak returned."
1045090439223,DIALOGUESCENE425_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Survivor's guilt?
1045090439224,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE14,I fear so.
1045090439225,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE15,"... I do not wish to pressure you or the adventurers, Guild Master. The Lich is a fearsome monster, which not even the church was able to defeat."
1045090439226,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE16,"However, I fear that as long as the Lich is out there, Zoldak will continue to try to confront the Lich himself."
1045090439227,DIALOGUESCENE425_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,We'll take care of it. I promise.
1045090439228,DIALOGUESCENE425_EDEN_DIALOGUE18,"Thank you, Guild Master. 
Meanwhile, I'll be taking care of Zoldak."
1045090439229,DIALOGUESCENE426_NORA_DIALOGUE1,M-Mr. Eden! Zoldak has freed himself of the restraints!
1045090439230,DIALOGUESCENE426_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>No mere restraints will be able to contain my righteous fury!
1045090439231,DIALOGUESCENE426_EDEN_DIALOGUE3,*Sighs*...
1045090439232,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Hi, Barret."
1045090439233,DIALOGUESCENE428_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,"Hello, Guild Master."
1045090439234,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,You wanted to talk to me?
1045090439235,DIALOGUESCENE428_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,"No.
But someone else."
1045090439236,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Guild Master! You have to see this!
1045090439237,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...oh. It's you.
1045090439238,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE7,"Watch my blade, Guild Master! Do you notice something different about it?"
1045090439239,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,It looks...sharper?
1045090439240,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE9,"<?shakeScreen>That's right! Master Smith has improved me! I'm a much deadlier weapon now! And furthermore, I can do this now!"
1045090439241,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE10,<?shakeScreen>Uhhhhhhnnnnn...!
1045090439242,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,<?whiteFlash> Did you just wiggle?
1045090439243,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE12,"<?shakeScreen>Perfect observation, Guild Master! I have gained the ability to move my body ever so slightly!"
1045090439244,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,...How did you do that?
1045090439245,DIALOGUESCENE428_BARRET_DIALOGUE14,It wasn't me.
1045090439246,DIALOGUESCENE428_BARRET_DIALOGUE15,"I'm good. 
Not <b>that</b> good."
1045090439247,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE16,"Maybe it's because when my blade gets improved, I'll also grow with it?"
1045090439248,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,Hmmm...you mean you could gain even more abilities when we upgrade you more?
1045090439249,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE18,That seems to be the case! And there is also something else!
1045090439250,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,There is even more to this?
1045090439251,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE20,<?shakeScreen>Yes! I started to remember my past!
1045090439252,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,Really? What did you remember?
1045090439253,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE22,<?shakeScreen>I remember that I've been stuck on that rock for more than 20 years!
1045090439254,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,...That's horrible...Why do you sound excited?
1045090439255,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE24,"<?shakeScreen>Don't you see, Guild Master? That means there is a possibility to find out about my past as long as we keep upgrading me!"
1045090439256,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE25,I didn't know you were that eager to know your past.
1045090439257,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE26,<?shakeScreen>Who wouldn't want to know about their past? Maybe I used to be some knight and some evil wizard turned me into a sword. Maybe I have a family? Maybe they're even still alive?
1045090439258,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,Are you sure you want to know that? It could make your current predicament seem worse.
1045090439259,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE28,"<?shakeScreen>Hah! You're asking the man who wouldn't break even knowing that he has been stuck on a boring rock for twenty years!
...Or maybe I'm a woman? I never considered that possibility."
1045090439260,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE29,"Why wouldn't I? Is that an indication that I'm a man? Or maybe I'm a woman who identifies himself as a man?
There are so many possibilities! "
1045090439261,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE30,<?shakeScreen>Guild Master! You have to help me regain my memories! I'm too excited to know!
1045090439262,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE31,"I guess we can do that, when we got the materials."
1045090439263,DIALOGUESCENE428_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE32,<?shakeScreen>Marvelous!
1045090439264,DIALOGUESCENE428_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE33,(I really hope you won't regret it.)
1045090439265,DIALOGUESCENE429_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,...Hello Guild Master.
1045090439266,DIALOGUESCENE429_BARRET_DIALOGUE2,...Ferdinand wants to talk with you.
1045090439267,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>GUILD MASTER! I've remembered more of my past!
1045090439268,DIALOGUESCENE429_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Oh...great! What did you remember?
1045090439269,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>I think I remembered how I got stuck in the rock.
1045090439270,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE6,I...I think someone put me there.
1045090439271,DIALOGUESCENE429_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Do you know who?
1045090439272,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE8,"No...Maybe if I get improved more, I'll remember..."
1045090439273,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreenWeak>Guild Master! I...I want to meet that person.
1045090439274,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE10,I may not remember now but...I feel like they're important somehow.
1045090439275,DIALOGUESCENE429_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"I see.
Well, there is no point in searching for a person we don't know, so let's talk again when you remember who it was."
1045090439276,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE12,"Y-yes! Of course, Guild Master! You're right...."
1045090439277,DIALOGUESCENE429_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,...
1045090439278,DIALOGUESCENE429_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,"<?whiteFlash>...Do you have any new abilities, you want to show off?"
1045090439279,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE15,"<?shakeScreen>Marvel at this, Guild Master!"
1045090439280,DIALOGUESCENE429_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE16,<?shakeScreen>I can change the shape of my blade now! Hahahaha!
1045090439281,DIALOGUESCENE430_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,...
1045090439282,DIALOGUESCENE430_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"You called, Barret?"
1045090439283,DIALOGUESCENE430_BARRET_DIALOGUE3,"Yes, Guild Master. It's about Ferdinand."
1045090439284,DIALOGUESCENE430_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,He's been acting strange ever since I upgraded him.
1045090439285,DIALOGUESCENE430_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Strange how?
1045090439286,DIALOGUESCENE430_BARRET_DIALOGUE6,He hasn't spoken a word since.
1045090439287,DIALOGUESCENE430_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,That is worrying for a blabbermouth like him. I'll talk to him.
1045090439288,DIALOGUESCENE430_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE8,...
1045090439289,DIALOGUESCENE430_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"Hey, Ferdinand! Is there something new you want to show me?"
1045090439290,DIALOGUESCENE430_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE10,...
1045090439291,DIALOGUESCENE430_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"Is something wrong? Speak to me, Ferdinand."
1045090439292,DIALOGUESCENE430_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreeen>(Wait...don't tell me he turned into an ordinary sword and I'm talking to thin air right now.)
1045090439293,DIALOGUESCENE431_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>...Oh! Guild Master! I-I didn't realize you were here!
1045090439294,DIALOGUESCENE431_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Phew! You had me worried there. I thought something might have happened to you.
1045090439295,DIALOGUESCENE431_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE3,"Oh, no! There is no need to fret about me, Guild Master.
...I was just contemplating something..."
1045090439296,DIALOGUESCENE431_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,What were you thinking about?
1045090439297,DIALOGUESCENE431_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE5,...Guild Master...I remember now. I remember who put me out there... His name was Zephyrion!
1045090439298,DIALOGUESCENE431_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Zephyrion, huh... What else do you remember about him?"
1045090439299,DIALOGUESCENE431_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE7,"...It's still foggy. I remember the name, but everything else about the man eludes me.
I can't even remember his face..."
1045090439300,DIALOGUESCENE431_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,And you still want to meet him?
1045090439301,DIALOGUESCENE431_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE9,"...I...
<?whiteFlash>Yes, Guild Master. I still want to meet him."
1045090439302,DIALOGUESCENE431_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"It won't be easy to find a man with only a name. At least the name is unusual enough that there can't be too many people with it.
Maybe I could ask some adventurers to try and find him."
1045090439303,DIALOGUESCENE431_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE11,"...Thank you, Guild Master"
1045090439304,DIALOGUESCENE431_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Don't mention it. I'm also a bit curious about the man who is connected to you.
1045090439305,DIALOGUESCENE431_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE13,"Still, you have my gratitude."
1045090439306,DIALOGUESCENE431_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...Don't you have anything else to tell me?
1045090439307,DIALOGUESCENE431_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE15,<?shakeScreen>Oh right! My new ability!
1045090439308,DIALOGUESCENE432_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>And Guild Master, have you found Zephyrion?"
1045090439309,DIALOGUESCENE432_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"...
It might be better if you lower your expectations, Ferdinand."
1045090439310,DIALOGUESCENE432_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE3,W-what do you mean?
1045090439311,DIALOGUESCENE432_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"...The adventurers have been searching far and wide for someone named Zephyrion, and they've only uncovered one lead to a man with that name.
"
1045090439312,DIALOGUESCENE432_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>I-It has to be him! Where is he?
1045090439313,DIALOGUESCENE432_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"You need to calmly listen to what I'm saying...
...He might already be dead."
1045090439314,DIALOGUESCENE432_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>W-What?!
1045090439315,DIALOGUESCENE432_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,It seems like your Zephyrion is an adventurer and has made the mistake of joining a coalition of adventurers who attempted to take on Vorathax The Terror together.
1045090439316,DIALOGUESCENE432_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE9,Vorathax the...Terror?
1045090439317,DIALOGUESCENE432_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"You don't know him? There are few who haven't heard the name. Vorathax is a giant red dragon, perhaps one of the most dangerous dragons known."
1045090439318,DIALOGUESCENE432_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"There have been numerous attempts to slay him – knights, adventurers, even armies of soldiers – but Vorathax has annihilated them all. Only fools or those with a death wish would try to challenge him now."
1045090439319,DIALOGUESCENE432_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE12,"<?shakeScreen>W-we need to save him, Guild Master!"
1045090439320,DIALOGUESCENE432_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,I don't think there's much hope left. It would be a miracle if he was still alive.
1045090439321,DIALOGUESCENE432_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE14,"B-but, but..."
1045090439322,DIALOGUESCENE432_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,It's better if you forget about him.
1045090439323,DIALOGUESCENE433_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>But I can't!
He's the one who created me!"
1045090439324,DIALOGUESCENE433_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045090439325,DIALOGUESCENE433_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE3,"I-I'm sorry for not telling you this before, but I think he's the one who created me.
No...I'm sure of it. "
1045090439326,DIALOGUESCENE433_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE4,"I know that I used to be an ordinary sword and someone named Zephyrion gave me life. 
I might not remember any details...but I know that's the truth."
1045094633472,DIALOGUESCENE433_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045094633473,DIALOGUESCENE433_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE6,"Guild Master...I know this is shameless, but I beg of you! 
Please save him!"
1045094633474,DIALOGUESCENE433_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE7,"I have nothing to offer you, nor do I have any power to influence you in any way
...but even so...please...save him!"
1045094633475,DIALOGUESCENE434_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"*sighs*...What are you talking about? You've given us plenty already.
You're a powerful weapon on our side and you should be more confident about it."
1045094633476,DIALOGUESCENE434_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"...
...I can't promise you that we'll find him alive."
1045094633477,DIALOGUESCENE434_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE3,"...Thank you, Guild Master! 
If there's even the smallest chance, then that's good enough for me."
1045094633478,DIALOGUESCENE435_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE1,"Hello, Guild Master."
1045094633479,DIALOGUESCENE435_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE2,Let me start by thanking you and your adventurers for saving my life. I don't know how much longer I could have survived like that.
1045094633480,DIALOGUESCENE435_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE3,It was only a matter of time before either my body would have succumbed or Vorathax got bored of watching me die.
1045094633481,DIALOGUESCENE435_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Hm...you're younger than I imagined.
1045094633482,DIALOGUESCENE435_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE5,Uh...Excuse me?
1045094633483,DIALOGUESCENE435_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>Sorry! Just thinking out loud.
1045094633484,DIALOGUESCENE435_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE7,"Okay... Anyway, I heard from your adventurers that you wanted to meet me."
1045094633485,DIALOGUESCENE435_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Not me. But this guy here.
1045094633486,DIALOGUESCENE435_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE9,"...
"
1045094633487,DIALOGUESCENE435_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE10,"A...sword? 
Is this a joke I'm not getting?"
1045094633488,DIALOGUESCENE435_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE11,...Guild Master. It's not him.
1045094633489,DIALOGUESCENE435_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreen>Ahhh! It's talking!
1045094633490,DIALOGUESCENE435_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"<?shakeScreen>You can't be serious, Ferdinand... 
We did all that and it turned out to be the wrong guy?"
1045094633491,DIALOGUESCENE436_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE1,"...Wait...Ferdinand? I think I'm recalling something.
<?shakeScreen>Wait! Are you by chance that magic sword that once belonged to my great-grandfather?"
1045094633492,DIALOGUESCENE436_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE2,Y-Your great-grandfather?
1045094633493,DIALOGUESCENE436_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE3,"Yes! I was named after him and I recall people saying that he had a unique sword he called Ferdinand!
 I did think that name was weird but now it makes a bit more sense."
1045094633494,DIALOGUESCENE436_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE4,And your great-grandfather...is he...
1045094633495,DIALOGUESCENE436_ZEPHYRION_DIALOGUE5,"I've never met him so I don't know what happened to him but realistically with how much time has passed, he has most likely died of old age by now."
1045094633496,DIALOGUESCENE436_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE6,...Oh...I see.
1045094633497,DIALOGUESCENE437_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"...So, the one who created you is already gone.
Sorry that you couldn't meet him."
1045094633498,DIALOGUESCENE437_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE2,It's alright...I...
1045094633499,DIALOGUESCENE437_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE3,"...No, it's true that I'm disappointed..."
1045094633500,DIALOGUESCENE437_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE4,I wanted to remember more of my past...but the one person tied to me is no longer there.
1045094633501,DIALOGUESCENE437_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE5,...
1045094633502,DIALOGUESCENE437_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE6,"<?shakeScreen>Guild Master! I need to be improved even more!
I can feel it! One more upgrade and I'll remember everything!"
1045094633503,DIALOGUESCENE437_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Is it still possible, Barret?"
1045094633504,DIALOGUESCENE437_BARRET_DIALOGUE8,"...Usually, I'd say no.
Ferdinand has already been enhanced with obsidian, and there is hardly any material in the world that could be considered better."
1045094633505,DIALOGUESCENE437_BARRET_DIALOGUE9,"<?whiteFlash>However, with the scale of Vorathax, it might just be possible."
1045094633506,DIALOGUESCENE437_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE10,"Please, Guild Master! Let us finally put an end to this story!"
1045094633507,DIALOGUESCENE438_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE1,...
1045094633508,DIALOGUESCENE438_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"... And how do you feel, Ferdinand?"
1045094633509,DIALOGUESCENE439_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045094633510,DIALOGUESCENE439_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>Are you crying?
(How is that even possible?)"
1045094633511,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE3,"... I was so afraid, Guild Master...
The more I learned about myself, the more I was afraid to learn the truth..."
1045094633512,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE4,"Why was I left on that rock? When I vaguely remembered that it was my creator...no, my father, who left me there... I was scared that I was hated."
1045094633513,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>But that wasn't the case...that wasn't the case at all!
1045094633514,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE6,I remember my father and the time we had together. I remember the childlike wonder on his face when I first awoke.
1045094633515,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE7,"I remember the adventures we had together, traveling the world, seeing things you wouldn't believe."
1045094633516,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE8,"I remember the time I still spent by his side, despite him settling down with his sweetheart and having no need for a weapon. I remember when he introduced me to his newborn daughter as her older brother."
1045094633517,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE9,I remember the time I consoled him when his wife passed away. I remember the time when I was the only one still by his side when he reached his golden years.
1045094633518,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE10,... I remember him putting the last bit of strength he had left into putting me into that rock after being deadly wounded by a bear.
1045094633519,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE11,I remember when he smiled one last time to me and said that one day people will find me and take care of me just like he did.
1045094633520,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE12,"<?shakeScreen>I was beloved, Guild Master! I was truly loved.
I'm so happy, Guild Master!"
1045094633521,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE13,I'm so grateful that you helped me regain my memories. Thank you for helping me remember.
1045094633522,DIALOGUESCENE439_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE14,I swear on my father's name that I will forever serve the Adventurer Guild as long as my blade hasn't rusted away. 
1045094633523,DIALOGUESCENE439_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"I'm glad to have you on our side, Ferdinand.
And I promise to your father, that as long as you're with us, we will also take care of you."
1045094633524,DIALOGUESCENE440_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,...Hmmm
1045094633525,DIALOGUESCENE440_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>Oh my!
1045094633526,DIALOGUESCENE440_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(It looks like Barret was sharpening the talking sword.)
1045094633527,DIALOGUESCENE440_BARRET_DIALOGUE4,...Did that hurt?
1045094633528,DIALOGUESCENE440_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,Interesting. Does that mean the sword has a sense of touch?
1045094633529,DIALOGUESCENE440_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE6,"My apologies, Master Smith it was an involuntary reaction. I got a little squeamish because this is my first time. At least I think it is."
1045094633530,DIALOGUESCENE440_BARRET_DIALOGUE7,...
1045094633531,DIALOGUESCENE440_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE8,"But you do not need to worry, Master Smith! It was just a response to a visual cue. I can in fact not feel anything by touch. You could rub my blade and I would feel nothing."
1045094633532,DIALOGUESCENE440_BARRET_DIALOGUE9,...
1045094633533,DIALOGUESCENE440_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE10,"How about it? Give it a try, and I assure you that you won't get a reaction out of me."
1045094633534,DIALOGUESCENE440_BARRET_DIALOGUE11,...No.
1045094633535,DIALOGUESCENE440_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE12,"<?shakeScreen>Why the reservation? I assure you that I will feel nothing, Master Smith. You do not need to be afraid of hurting me!"
1045094633536,DIALOGUESCENE440_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,(I'm pretty sure that he has other reasons why he wouldn't want to do that.)
1045094633537,DIALOGUESCENE440_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE14,<?whiteFlash>...
1045094633538,DIALOGUESCENE440_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE15,<?shakeScreen>M-My lady!
1045094633539,DIALOGUESCENE440_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE16,"My apologies, but I was under the impression that your challenge to test your statement would also extend to anyone else in this room."
1045094633540,DIALOGUESCENE440_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE17,"N-No, of course.
I was just surprised that a lady would touch my blade."
1045094633541,DIALOGUESCENE440_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE18,...
1045094633542,DIALOGUESCENE440_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE19,"<?whiteFlash>The talking sword, which seems to identify itself as a male, shows signs of carnal desires in spite of being an object. Also very likely ticklish, despite claiming otherwise."
1045094633543,DIALOGUESCENE440_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE20,"<?shakeScreen> A-Are those notes about me?
I beg you not to write that down! I'm not a degenerate!"
1045094633544,DIALOGUESCENE441_BARRET_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>!
Hello Guild Master."
1045094633545,DIALOGUESCENE441_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Hello, Barret. I see you have your hands full."
1045094633546,DIALOGUESCENE441_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE3,"<?shakeScreen>Oh! Greetings! You must be the Guild Master, I have heard so much about!
I'm Ferdinand and it might be hard to believe but I'm a..."
1045094633547,DIALOGUESCENE441_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"...A talking sword. Yeah, yeah. I read the reports."
1045094633548,DIALOGUESCENE441_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I see you seem to be interested in the sword. Does that mean it's in some way related to the ancient empire?
1045094633549,DIALOGUESCENE441_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,"That was my initial hope. After all, many wondrous items we have found today have been produced by the craftsmen of the ancient empire. "
1045094633550,DIALOGUESCENE441_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,"Unfortunately, to my disappointment, the sword seems to be too relatively new for it to be the case."
1045094633551,DIALOGUESCENE441_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,"Nevertheless, it still might prove to be an interesting subject to study in my spare time."
1045094633552,DIALOGUESCENE441_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE9,"...That statement doesn't exactly boost my self-confidence, my lady."
1045094633553,DIALOGUESCENE441_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"So, why is it here? "
1045094633554,DIALOGUESCENE441_BARRET_DIALOGUE11,One of the adventurers wanted to know if it was possible to improve it.
1045094633555,DIALOGUESCENE441_BARRET_DIALOGUE12,"Despite it being a talking sword, they said it seems...unimpressive."
1045094633556,DIALOGUESCENE441_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE13,"And with that my self-confidence just took another hit, Master Smith."
1045094633557,DIALOGUESCENE441_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,And is it possible to improve it?
1045094633558,DIALOGUESCENE441_BARRET_DIALOGUE15,"It is.
With the right materials."
1045094633559,DIALOGUESCENE441_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,I'll see if I can provide you with the materials if possible.
1045094633560,DIALOGUESCENE441_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE17,"Given that you are already working on the item, Barret, it may be worthwhile to consider fully smelting it down and utilize the materials to craft a new weapon."
1045094633561,DIALOGUESCENE441_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE18,I'm interested to see if it retains its personality after such a transformation.
1045094633562,DIALOGUESCENE441_FERDINAND_DIALOGUE19,"...My lady, I officially declare that I am afraid of you and beg the others to get me as far away as possible from you."
1045094633563,DIALOGUESCENE442_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Did you use to be an adventurer?
1045094633564,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,No...why would you think that?
1045094633565,DIALOGUESCENE442_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,It just seemed very likely in a place like this.
1045094633566,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,If you really want to know...I joined the Adventurer Guild because of my husband.
1045094633567,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,He was an adventurer and he was also one of the first adventurers to join the Adventurer Guild.
1045094633568,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE6,When he joined the Guild I opened a Tavern here with the help of the former Guild Master.
1045094633569,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,It was my way of staying close to him. Because my family used to run a tavern in Cragmond I had no trouble with running one in the Guild. 
1045094633570,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE8,"Sure, adventurers can be a rougher bunch than most but my husband always had a knack for reminding people not to cause any trouble in my tavern."
1045094633571,DIALOGUESCENE442_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"...You say he ""was"" an adventurer..."
1045094633572,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE10,...
1045094633573,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE11,He never got to retire.
1045094633574,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE12,But I guess that was never unexpected. That's the life of an adventurer for you.
1045094633575,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE13,One day you were making plans for the future together and on the next day there is none to be had.
1045094633576,DIALOGUESCENE442_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,I see...
1045094633577,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE15,"There is no need to feel sorry for me, Guild Master. It happened a long time ago. "
1045094633578,DIALOGUESCENE442_TAVI_DIALOGUE16,Right now I'm more concerned about people paying their tabs.
1045094633579,DIALOGUESCENE443_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,*Hics* Can I have another one?
1045094633580,DIALOGUESCENE443_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,You already had enough you lightweight.
1045094633581,DIALOGUESCENE443_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>W-who *hics* are you calling a lightweight?! I ain't dunk yet! *Hics*
1045094633582,DIALOGUESCENE443_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,Suuure. 
1045094633583,DIALOGUESCENE443_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,"Oh, hi Fiola and hi Falken! Is this..."
1045094633584,DIALOGUESCENE443_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,Hello Tavi. That's right this is unfortunately the new Guild Master...
1045094633585,DIALOGUESCENE443_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,"""Unfortunately?""..."
1045094633586,DIALOGUESCENE443_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,Don't mind them. Just introduce yourself.
1045094633587,DIALOGUESCENE443_TAVI_DIALOGUE9,Hello Guild Master. I am Tavi and this Tavern belongs to me. This is where all the adventurers go when they need to relax.
1045094633588,DIALOGUESCENE443_TAVI_DIALOGUE10,"If you think someone had a hard day, just send them to me and I'll make them drink until they're too intoxicated to even remember why they were sad in the first place."
1045094633589,DIALOGUESCENE443_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,I would have phrased it differently but yes. Sometimes the former Guild Master would buy drinks for adventurers to raise morale.
1045094633590,DIALOGUESCENE443_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,It is actually quite efficient. My advice is to keep that tradition and occasionally buy a drink or two for the adventurers.
1045094633591,DIALOGUESCENE443_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Anything else I should keep in mind here?
1045094633592,DIALOGUESCENE443_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,"As I already said before, usually new adventurers who would like to join the Guild will also arrive here."
1045094633593,DIALOGUESCENE443_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15,"In the past we would get adventurers from all over the world, wanting to join us. Many, who have already made a name for themselves."
1045094633594,DIALOGUESCENE443_FALKEN_DIALOGUE16,"Nowadays however, the only people who come here are people who are too inexperienced and too weak to make it on their own."
1045094633595,DIALOGUESCENE443_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE17,<?shakeScreen>Hey! I heard that!
1045094633596,DIALOGUESCENE443_FIOLA_DIALOGUE18,So what? If you have a problem with that then prove him wrong!
1045094633597,DIALOGUESCENE443_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE19,....
1045094633598,DIALOGUESCENE443_FIOLA_DIALOGUE20,That's what I thought.
1045094633599,DIALOGUESCENE443_FALKEN_DIALOGUE21,<speed=0.5>...Annyyywayy...<speed=1>we should start looking for adventurers here. At least enough to field a full party of four on a quest.
1045094633600,DIALOGUESCENE443_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,Okay. Got it.
1045094633601,DIALOGUESCENE443_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE23,Heeeeey! How about meeee.......
1045094633602,DIALOGUESCENE443_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE24,*Bleurgh!*<?fadeOutNPC>
1045094633603,DIALOGUESCENE443_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE25,...
1045098827776,DIALOGUESCENE443_FIOLA_DIALOGUE26,...
1045098827777,DIALOGUESCENE443_FALKEN_DIALOGUE27,...
1045098827778,DIALOGUESCENE443_TAVI_DIALOGUE28,"As I said:<waitfor=1>
Lightweight."
1045098827779,DIALOGUESCENE444_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,How have been things lately?
1045098827780,DIALOGUESCENE444_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,"Well, the amount of injured travellers arriving here has increased and they all tell the same story:  Bandits attacking people and not letting them leave in peace."
1045098827781,DIALOGUESCENE444_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,I don't know if this how the survivors try to cope with the shock but the stories they're telling isn't really great for the morale of the adventurers.
1045098827782,DIALOGUESCENE444_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,It has been quite depressing in the Tavern...
1045098827783,DIALOGUESCENE445_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,Sussshh!! Don't mention that name in here!
1045098827784,DIALOGUESCENE445_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,Every traveller that comes through here has already heard of him and every time someone mentions B.K. the mood here takes a deep dive.
1045098827785,DIALOGUESCENE445_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"So, he already made a name for himself."
1045098827786,DIALOGUESCENE445_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,You tell me! There are a lot of stories floating around him and it's hard to tell which ones are real and which are pure exaggeration.
1045098827787,DIALOGUESCENE445_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,But one thing is certain. This bandit king is a terrifying man.
1045098827788,DIALOGUESCENE446_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,"The Divine Messenger, huh?"
1045098827789,DIALOGUESCENE446_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,Maybe this time I'll be able to catch a glimpse of her.
1045098827790,DIALOGUESCENE446_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,You never saw her?
1045098827791,DIALOGUESCENE446_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,I never did. In the past she usually just visited the Guild Master and left shortly after.
1045098827792,DIALOGUESCENE446_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,Didn't even come in for a drink before they left. I guess religious people aren't just that fond of taverns.
1045098827793,DIALOGUESCENE446_TAVI_DIALOGUE6,For example I've been trying for ages to get Eden to have a drink in here but haven't had any success yet.
1045098827794,DIALOGUESCENE446_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Why?
1045098827795,DIALOGUESCENE446_TAVI_DIALOGUE8,"Come on, Guild Master. Don't tell me you are not interested in seeing Eden drunk?"
1045098827796,DIALOGUESCENE446_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...I retract the question.
1045098827797,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,I feel like no amount of alcohol could make me forget that day.
1045098827798,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,"It was a late night for me and while I was preparing to go to bed, I suddenly heard fighting."
1045098827799,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,At first I thought some drunken adventurers were getting into a fight and I was already prepared to give them a stern warning.
1045098827800,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE4,"However, when I stepped outside, I immediately realized that wasn't what was happening."
1045098827801,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE5,"...They were seriously trying to kill each other, Guild Master..."
1045098827802,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE6,I ran back into the tavern and hid in the wine cellar until it was over.
1045098827803,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE7,I didn't come out until Falken and some others found me and told me it was over.
1045098827804,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE8,...
1045098827805,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE9,Adventurers can be rough around the edges...but I always thought of them all as good people.
1045098827806,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE10,"Even after we identified the people, who betrayed the Guild...I still couldn't believe it."
1045098827807,DIALOGUESCENE447_TAVI_DIALOGUE11,They were people I knew. People with whom we shared drinks and laughter...
1045098827808,DIALOGUESCENE447_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...
1045098827809,DIALOGUESCENE448_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,"Looks can be deceiving, can't they?"
1045098827810,DIALOGUESCENE448_TAVI_DIALOGUE2,I would have never guessed that a young looking girl like her would be the witch that caused all those deaths.
1045098827811,DIALOGUESCENE448_TAVI_DIALOGUE3,"Well, now that she's behind bars, hopefully people don't have to fear for their souls anymore."
1045098827812,DIALOGUESCENE449_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,"Here for a drink, Guild Master?"
1045098827813,DIALOGUESCENE450_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,There is always a seat free for you here.
1045098827814,DIALOGUESCENE451_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,Still don't want that drink?
1045098827815,DIALOGUESCENE452_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,Anything else you want to talk about?
1045098827816,DIALOGUESCENE453_TAVI_DIALOGUE1,Here for a drink?

1045098827862,DIALOGUESCENE456_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,And still not enough space for the both of us.
1045098827863,DIALOGUESCENE457_EDEN_DIALOGUE1,My apologies. I hope you two didn't have to wait long.
1045098827864,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,It's fine. We've just arrived.
1045098827865,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,So what is it that you needed <b>both</b> of us here?.
1045098827866,DIALOGUESCENE457_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,...
1045098827867,DIALOGUESCENE457_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,...I've received a letter...from the Divine Messenger.
1045098827868,DIALOGUESCENE457_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045098827869,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,The Divine Messenger? You mean the person supposedly chosen by the gods to be their speaker?
1045098827870,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,They are real?
1045098827871,DIALOGUESCENE457_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,"...Yes, Guild Master. "
1045098827872,DIALOGUESCENE457_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,"And she wants to meet you, Guild Master."
1045098827873,DIALOGUESCENE457_EDEN_DIALOGUE11,...I think she requires the Guild's services.
1045098827874,DIALOGUESCENE457_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreen>NO!
1045098827875,DIALOGUESCENE457_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreen>Tell her that she can go to hell for all I care!

1045098827877,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,(Again?)
1045098827878,DIALOGUESCENE457_EDEN_DIALOGUE16,"Fiola. I understand how you feel, but this is a request from the Divine Messenger herself. I don't think refusing her will go well for us."
1045098827879,DIALOGUESCENE457_FIOLA_DIALOGUE17,<?shakeScreen> I don't care! It's because of her that Fran...
1045098827880,DIALOGUESCENE457_FIOLA_DIALOGUE18,...that Fran...
1045098827881,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,...
1045098827882,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,(...I think I have been avoiding that topic for too long...)
1045098827883,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,Fiola...Tell me...
1045098827884,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,What happened to Fran?
1045098827885,DIALOGUESCENE457_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,...
1045098827886,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"Four years ago, the reputation of the Adventurer Guild was at its peak. We had helped numerous people, and they had placed their trust in us. Quests would pour in from every corner of the country."
1045098827887,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,"Then, one day, the Divine Messenger herself visited us and requested our services."
1045098827888,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,"We were elated, believing this to be the culmination of all our achievements. We thought that by undertaking her quests, the Guild would become famous across the continent."
1045098827889,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"However, things took a different turn."
1045098827890,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,"The quests we were assigned were perilous. Frequently, we would lose adventurers during these missions because we were kept in the dark about the true nature of the threats we faced. "
1045098827891,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,"Initially, it appeared that we were simply sent to deal with cultists, demon worshippers, and other heretics."
1045098827892,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,"Little did we know that they were all part of the same powerful cult, one that would eventually wage war against the Adventurer Guild in retaliation."
1045098827893,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,"Over time, our adventurers would get ambushed by unknown assailants during their quests. Some were discovered dead in alleys, their backs pierced by daggers."
1045098827894,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,We struggled a lot in those years. Adventurers left us out of fear. We were unable to complete more and more Quests.
1045098827895,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,"People started to lose their trust in us and our reputation detoriated. 
In just three years, we were reduced to a mere shadow of our former selves."
1045098827896,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,"But that wasn't enough for them.
One day we were attacked from within."
1045098827897,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,As it turned out many of our adventurers who joined us were cultists themselves and under the cover of the night they launched an assault on their comrades.
1045098827898,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,"People fought, not knowing who was friend or foe. We were betrayed by people we considered friend and family."
1045098827899,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE14,Many lives were lost that night...
1045098827900,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE15,Including Fran...
1045098827901,DIALOGUESCENE458_FIOLA_DIALOGUE16,"Afterwards, you know what happened. Fran seems to have feared his own death and prepared a last will, where he made you the new Guild Master."
1045098827902,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,We lost everything. And what did we receive in return for our services?
1045098827903,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,Nothing!
1045098827904,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,When we were of no use to them anymore the Divine Messenger just left with the shattered remains of everything Fran worked so hard for!
1045098827905,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,There is nothing good that will come out of dealing with that woman!
1045098827906,DIALOGUESCENE459_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045098827907,DIALOGUESCENE459_EDEN_DIALOGUE6,...I agree with you. If we could then I'd also prefer for us to stay away from whatever she needs the Guild to do.
1045098827908,DIALOGUESCENE459_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"However, the Divine Messenger is a human chosen by the gods themselves. Not even kings or queens can ignore her."
1045098827909,DIALOGUESCENE459_EDEN_DIALOGUE8,I fear what might happen if we do.
1045098827910,DIALOGUESCENE459_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,"...Guild Master.
As the one leading the Guild it's your decision."
1045098827911,DIALOGUESCENE459_EDEN_DIALOGUE10,How should we respond?
1045098827912,DIALOGUESCENE459_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"...
Tell her that we will receive her."
1045098827913,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,<?whiteFlash>Why you...!
1045098827914,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreen> Didn't you listen to a word I said?
1045098827915,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE14,<?shakeScreen> Don't you care about the Guild at all?!
1045098827916,DIALOGUESCENE459_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,<?shakeScreen> Of course I care!
1045098827917,DIALOGUESCENE459_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,That's why I have to meet the person responsible for what had happened.
1045098827918,DIALOGUESCENE459_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"Eden, answer her as soon as you can."
1045098827919,DIALOGUESCENE459_EDEN_DIALOGUE18,"Yes, Guild Master!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045098827920,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE19,You're making a mistake!
1045098827921,DIALOGUESCENE459_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,It's my decision.
1045098827922,DIALOGUESCENE459_FIOLA_DIALOGUE21,I remember now why I can't stand you! HMPF! <?fadeOutNPC>
1045098827923,DIALOGUESCENE459_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,...
1045098827924,DIALOGUESCENE460_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,*Sighs*. Where is that poor excuse of a Guild Master?
1045098827925,DIALOGUESCENE460_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>...?
1045098827926,DIALOGUESCENE460_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,...and that's all I could find out.
1045098827927,DIALOGUESCENE460_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Thank you, Rogue."
1045098827928,DIALOGUESCENE460_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,"No problem, Guild Master. I'm glad I could help you in this situation."
1045098827929,DIALOGUESCENE460_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,"Until later then, Guild Master. <?fadeOutNPC>"
1045098827930,DIALOGUESCENE460_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,"So, this is where you are."
1045098827931,DIALOGUESCENE460_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Fiola.
1045098827932,DIALOGUESCENE460_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,I'd like to ask what you were doing but I'm sure I'll just be disappointed by the answer.
1045098827933,DIALOGUESCENE460_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,Instead just let's go. 
1045098827934,DIALOGUESCENE461_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045098827935,DIALOGUESCENE461_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,"<?whiteFlash>Greetings, Guild Master."
1045098827936,DIALOGUESCENE461_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...
1045098827937,DIALOGUESCENE461_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...So you're the...
1045098827938,DIALOGUESCENE461_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Stay back! Do not come one step closer!
1045103022080,DIALOGUESCENE461_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Whoa! Easy there, tiger!"
1045103022081,DIALOGUESCENE461_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,My apologies Guild Master. My bodyguard takes his job very seriously.
1045103022082,DIALOGUESCENE461_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,I would have never guessed.
1045103022083,DIALOGUESCENE461_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE9,"Also greetings to you, Mrs. Fiola. It's a pleasure to meet you again."
1045103022084,DIALOGUESCENE461_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,That makes only one of us.
1045103022085,DIALOGUESCENE461_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE11,...I can see that you're still angry about what has happened in the past.
1045103022086,DIALOGUESCENE461_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE12,Believe me when I say that I'm truly sorry about your losses.
1045103022087,DIALOGUESCENE462_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,Tell that to my dead husband.
1045103022088,DIALOGUESCENE462_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,...How about we change the subject and talk about business instead?
1045103022089,DIALOGUESCENE462_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"That's fine with me, eh..."
1045103022090,DIALOGUESCENE462_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,"Just call me your Holiness, Guild Master."
1045103022091,DIALOGUESCENE462_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(How humble...)
1045103022092,DIALOGUESCENE462_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Alright, your ""Holiness"". What does the Divine Messenger herself want from the Adventurer Guild?"
1045103022093,DIALOGUESCENE462_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,The gods have been watching the Adventurer Guild and are quite pleased to see that it has regained its strength.
1045103022094,DIALOGUESCENE462_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE8,"They believe that the Adventurer Guild can once again become an instrument of good. You should be flattered, Guild Master."
1045103022095,DIALOGUESCENE462_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...
1045103022096,DIALOGUESCENE462_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE10,They only ask that the Guild will take on any Quests they give to you and that you prioritize them over all else.
1045103022097,DIALOGUESCENE462_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,And what do we get in return?
1045103022098,DIALOGUESCENE462_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE12,The Church of the Divines has enough gold to pay for all the Quest Fees. Of course we will pay well above the rate you usually charge.
1045103022099,DIALOGUESCENE462_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,...
1045103022100,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>That's not enough.
1045103022101,DIALOGUESCENE463_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>What?! You insolent...!
1045103022102,DIALOGUESCENE463_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,"...I'm sure we have more than enough to pay any fee you could think of, Guild Master."
1045103022103,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I'm not after more gold.
1045103022104,DIALOGUESCENE463_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,Then what do you want?
1045103022105,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I want for the Guild to have the same status as the Church of the Divines.
1045103022106,DIALOGUESCENE463_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,<?whiteFlash>!!
1045103022107,DIALOGUESCENE463_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE8,...What do you mean?
1045103022108,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Just like the church of the Divines I want the Adventurer Guild to have full autonomy. I want it to be a separate entity not directly subject to any king or other ruling authority.
1045103022109,DIALOGUESCENE463_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE10,I'm not sure that's what we're able to give you.
1045103022110,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"Are you sure about that? I'm certain that when the seven divines themselves decree it, then the nine kingdoms will surely pass royal decrees to guarantee our independence."
1045103022111,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,The church alone should have enough political leverage and moral authority to at least be able to negotiate those terms for us.
1045103022112,DIALOGUESCENE463_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE13,And what if we refuse?
1045103022113,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,"Then the Guild won't help you.
And I'm certain that would put you in quite the inconvenient spot."
1045103022114,DIALOGUESCENE463_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE15,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045103022115,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,"You see, I have been digging a bit and it seems like in the last few months alone you have been hiring dozens of adventurer parties, most of which ended up either dead or missing."
1045103022116,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"Additionally, many of your paladins have died under mysterious circumstances and considering your bodyguard, I'm certain that you yourself have been the target of assassination attempts."
1045103022117,DIALOGUESCENE463_FIOLA_DIALOGUE18,(...Was that what Rogue was supposed to find out for {PROTAGONIST}?)
1045103022118,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,It's obvious you're in a war...and it's also obvious that you're losing it.
1045103022119,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,That's why you want to hire people like us as your mercenaries.
1045103022120,DIALOGUESCENE463_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE21,...The gods do not appreciate to be extorted like that.
1045103022121,DIALOGUESCENE463_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE22,Are you sure you're willing to offend them with your answer?
1045103022122,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,...I don't care.
1045103022123,DIALOGUESCENE463_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,I'm here to make sure that you pay the price that my best friend should have deserved in the first place.
1045103022124,DIALOGUESCENE463_FIOLA_DIALOGUE25,{PROTAGONIST}...
1045103022125,DIALOGUESCENE464_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash><?shakeScreen>I've had enough of this!
1045103022126,DIALOGUESCENE464_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,*Pulls weapon*<?shakeScreen> What stops us from just killing you and then negotiate with your successor?
1045103022127,DIALOGUESCENE464_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...Good luck having the adventurers follow you after you kill their Guild Master during a negotiation.
1045103022128,DIALOGUESCENE464_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,It's important for clients to be able to trust their adventurers...
1045103022129,DIALOGUESCENE464_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...but people seem to miss that it's equally important for adventurers to be able to trust their clients.
1045103022130,DIALOGUESCENE464_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE6,Y-You....!
1045103022131,DIALOGUESCENE464_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,....bw...
1045103022132,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen><?whiteFlash>BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
1045103022133,DIALOGUESCENE465_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(...This wasn't the reaction I expected...)
1045103022134,DIALOGUESCENE465_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE3,Y-Your Holiness!
1045103022135,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,*sniff* In all my years I have never seen anyone make a hard bargain with the seven divines like that.
1045103022136,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,"Very well, Guild Master!
You win!"
1045103022137,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,"If you help us win this war, as you put it nicely, then the Church will be the first to acknowledge the authority of the Adventurer Guild and help you gain the recognition of all nine kingdoms."
1045103022138,DIALOGUESCENE465_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,(That was easier than I expected it to be...)
1045103022139,DIALOGUESCENE465_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Then we have a deal.
1045103022140,DIALOGUESCENE465_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>No touching!
1045103022141,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE10,...It's a deal even without the handshake.
1045103022142,DIALOGUESCENE465_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"So, what is supposed to be our first task?"
1045103022143,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE12,The gods will reveal to me their plans when the time is right...
1045103022144,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE13,<?whiteFlash>...so meanwhile I will be staying here until that happens.
1045103022145,DIALOGUESCENE465_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,What?
1045103022146,DIALOGUESCENE465_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE15,<?shakeScreen>WHAT!?
1045103022147,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE16,Why not? I think this arrangement would be far more convenient than traveling back and forth.
1045103022148,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE17,And I do like to see more of the Guild. I didn't have the chance the last time I was here.
1045103022149,DIALOGUESCENE465_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE18,I think I saw a tavern on my way here. I always wondered what it would look like inside.<?fadeoutNPC>
1045103022150,DIALOGUESCENE465_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE19,<?shakeScreen> B-But your Holiness!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045103022151,DIALOGUESCENE466_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"...*sighs*...That was nerve-racking.
(Pretty sure I'm going to hell now.)"
1045103022152,DIALOGUESCENE466_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,Was that your goal all along?
1045103022153,DIALOGUESCENE466_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...Yeah.
I got the idea when Eden was worried about what happens if we don't submit ourselves to the authority of the church."
1045103022154,DIALOGUESCENE466_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"I realized that we will probably face that problem more often in the future, the more we grow. At some point we might end up as a political tool."
1045103022155,DIALOGUESCENE466_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I don't think Fran wants that for the Guild.
1045103022156,DIALOGUESCENE466_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,...
1045103022157,DIALOGUESCENE466_FIOLA_DIALOGUE7,<?whiteFlash>Who would have thought? There is a brain inside that head of yours after all.
1045103022158,DIALOGUESCENE466_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Hah! That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
1045103022159,DIALOGUESCENE467_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE1,Hey you!
1045103022160,DIALOGUESCENE467_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,"Her Holiness wants to see you.
Do not let her wait."
1045103022161,DIALOGUESCENE467_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I hope being rude wasn't part of your job description.
1045103022162,DIALOGUESCENE467_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE4,Tsk!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045103022163,DIALOGUESCENE468_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>H-Hello, Guild Master. It's nice to see you!"
1045103022164,DIALOGUESCENE468_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,...
1045103022165,DIALOGUESCENE468_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"(I guess the two of you being alone together is a rather awkward atmosphere for you, isn't it?)"
1045103022166,DIALOGUESCENE468_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"...So, what is that you wanted to talk to me about?"
1045103022167,DIALOGUESCENE468_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,...We finally have a task for you.
1045103022168,DIALOGUESCENE468_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I see. So what's the job?
1045103022169,DIALOGUESCENE469_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,"Before I do that, it might be time to tell you who our enemy is. The gods have given me permission to do so."
1045103022170,DIALOGUESCENE469_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(Probably just as much as I'm allowed to know.)
1045103022171,DIALOGUESCENE469_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,"Please be aware that the gods do not wish the knowledge to be spread lest, it may incite unrest amongst the people. Anything we discuss here, must stay between us."
1045103022172,DIALOGUESCENE469_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Fine...so who are we dealing with?
1045103022173,DIALOGUESCENE469_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,You might have already encountered them. After all they were the reason why the bandits in this area have become such a problem.
1045103022174,DIALOGUESCENE469_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...I already suspected something was off when the adventurers reported that they encountered a demon in their final confrontation with the bandit king.
1045103022175,DIALOGUESCENE469_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"How could bandits be connected with demons?...Even the weapon he wielded, doesn't seem like something you could just normally aquire."
1045103022176,DIALOGUESCENE469_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,"They've been supported by the same people who attacked us, haven't they?"
1045103022177,DIALOGUESCENE469_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE9,"Yes, that's right."
1045103022178,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,They are the servants of the seven demon lords.
1045103022179,DIALOGUESCENE470_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,So they're a cult?
1045103022180,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,"They're far more dangerous than any ordinary cult, Guild Master."
1045103022181,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,These people have existed for hundreds of years and have ever since been causing suffering and deaths on a grand scale.
1045103022182,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,"And furthermore, they're led by an avatar not unlike me. A woman chosen by the demon lords."
1045103022183,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,We call her the Demon Witch.
1045103022184,DIALOGUESCENE470_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,What is their goal?
1045103022185,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE8,The same as it has always been. To collect souls for their masters.
1045103022186,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE9,"They search for people who crave power and in exchange for granting them those powers, they sacrifice people in the name of the demon lords."
1045103022187,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE10,"We, the church, have been at war with them for centuries to protect the souls of our fellow humans."
1045103022188,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE11,"Unfortunately, the war isn't going as well as we would like to. That's why we had to rely on people like your adventurers to fight our battle for us."
1045103022189,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE12,"Even for this task, we can only rely on you, Guild Master."
1045103022190,DIALOGUESCENE470_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,"...Demons, witches, Demon Lords..."
1045103022191,DIALOGUESCENE470_FIOLA_DIALOGUE14,<?shakeScreen>You should have told us that from the beginning!
1045103022192,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE15,"I'm sorry.
But the gods deemed it unnecessary to let you know more than you should."
1045103022193,DIALOGUESCENE470_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE16,Knowing that there is a war for their souls could frighten the people.
1045103022194,DIALOGUESCENE470_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,(...that still sounds like it's not the complete truth.)
1045103022195,DIALOGUESCENE470_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"(However, I don't think they'd be willing to reveal more if I try to press them.)"
1045103022196,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Alright, fine! We know now what we're dealing with."
1045103022197,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"So, what is it that you need us now for?"
1045103022198,DIALOGUESCENE471_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,"The witch has started to make a pact with another group. A group of jotuns, calling themselves the Icefang Tribe."
1045103022199,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>Jotuns? You mean the warriors of the north?
1045103022200,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,They're already fearsome warriors on their own. I do not want to know how much worse it gets when they have the support of demons.
1045103022201,DIALOGUESCENE471_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,"...Unfortunately, it gets worse. A monastery of ours has been raided by them and they have taken numerous people captive."
1045103022202,DIALOGUESCENE471_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>We have to save them!
1045103022203,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,How old is that information? Can we even get to them in time?
1045103022204,DIALOGUESCENE471_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE9,Mere minutes. The Gods have been keeping an eye out and immediately notified me.
1045103022205,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"(Well, that's kinda convenient.)
Alright, I'll send some adventurers."
1045103022206,DIALOGUESCENE471_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE11,"Wonderful, Guild Master! Tell them to meet me when they're ready to go."
1045103022207,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"Meet you? Don't tell me, you're going to go too."
1045103022208,DIALOGUESCENE471_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE13,Of course! It will be far easier for the adventurers to follow the jotuns with the guidance of the divines.
1045103022209,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...Then I'll come too.
1045103022210,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,I want to see where this is going.
1045103022211,DIALOGUESCENE471_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE16,Very well. Then we will go and save the captives together!
1045103022212,DIALOGUESCENE471_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE17,Hmph!
1045103022213,DIALOGUESCENE471_FIOLA_DIALOGUE18,...
1045103022214,DIALOGUESCENE471_FIOLA_DIALOGUE19,"<?whiteFlash>Be careful, {PROTAGONIST}."
1045103022215,DIALOGUESCENE471_FIOLA_DIALOGUE20,I'd rather not have to look for another Guild Master.
1045103022216,DIALOGUESCENE471_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,"Geez, don't scare me like that."
1045103022217,DIALOGUESCENE472_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,It's eerie how quiet it is.
1045103022218,DIALOGUESCENE472_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,Are you sure that this is the place where the Emperor's body is hidden?
1045103022219,DIALOGUESCENE472_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I'm certain. It looks just like the way I saw it in the vision.
1045103022220,DIALOGUESCENE472_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,It's strange that we didn't encounter any resistance so far. I'm getting scared that something might be wrong.
1045103022221,DIALOGUESCENE472_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Are we maybe already too late?
1045103022222,DIALOGUESCENE472_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>T-That can't be! The gods are certain that there is still a substantial number of souls needed to revive the emperor.
1045103022223,DIALOGUESCENE472_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,They couldn't have possibly collected them all in such a short time!
1045103022224,DIALOGUESCENE472_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE8,T-They're sure of it.
1045103022225,DIALOGUESCENE472_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"Well, no other way to find out than to move forward."
1045103022226,DIALOGUESCENE473_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,(Alright...{PROTAGONIST}. No need to feel nervous.)
1045103022227,DIALOGUESCENE473_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(Just breathe in....and breathe out..)
1045103022228,DIALOGUESCENE473_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(Breathe in....)
1045103022229,DIALOGUESCENE473_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,(Breathe out....)
1045103022230,DIALOGUESCENE474_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,...What are you doing?
1045103022231,DIALOGUESCENE474_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"What does it look like?
<?shakeScreen>I'm trying to calm myself down! "
1045103022232,DIALOGUESCENE474_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Some words of encouragement would be helpful!
1045103022233,DIALOGUESCENE474_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"<?shakeScreen>Listen to me here, {PROTAGONIST}!
We're about to meet every King and Queen on this continent!"
1045103022234,DIALOGUESCENE474_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,Your demeanor will affect whether they'll recognize the Adventurer Guild as an independant organization or not!
1045103022235,DIALOGUESCENE474_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,"<?shakeScreen>So, don't screw this up!"
1045103022236,DIALOGUESCENE474_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>That does not help at all! I'm going to lose my mind!
Breathe in...Breathe out..."
1045107216384,DIALOGUESCENE474_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,Hnngh....
1045107216385,DIALOGUESCENE475_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>There is no need for you to get nervous.
1045107216386,DIALOGUESCENE475_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,I...know you can do this. You stood before greater obstacles and managed to overcome them all.
1045107216387,DIALOGUESCENE475_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,This is nothing compared to that...
1045107216388,DIALOGUESCENE475_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"I-I...b-believe in you, because..."
1045107216389,DIALOGUESCENE475_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Because?
1045107216390,DIALOGUESCENE475_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,...because you're a great Guild Master!
1045107216391,DIALOGUESCENE476_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"...<?whiteFlash>Alright, I think that's the best I can get out of you."
1045107216392,DIALOGUESCENE476_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>Did you just pretend to be nervous?!
1045107216393,DIALOGUESCENE476_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Oh come on, Fiola. I've met a real god! This is nothing compared to that. I was just trying to see how far you'd go to cheer me up."
1045107216394,DIALOGUESCENE476_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,...Why you!!!
1045107216395,DIALOGUESCENE477_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>Alright, guys! You can come in! Everyone is already excited to see you two!"
1045107216396,DIALOGUESCENE477_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Alright. We'll be right behind you, Lily.<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045107216397,DIALOGUESCENE477_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,<?whiteFlash>Hey!
1045107216398,DIALOGUESCENE477_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,...
1045107216399,DIALOGUESCENE477_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>You can do this!
1045107216400,DIALOGUESCENE478_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...Aren't you cold running around like that?
1045107216401,DIALOGUESCENE478_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,"It's fine, Guild Master. The gods' blessing also protects me from the cold."
1045107216402,DIALOGUESCENE478_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Ain't that convenient. Probably means that me freezing here is a sign of their disfavor.
1045107216403,DIALOGUESCENE478_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Are you sure that we're on the right track?
1045107216404,DIALOGUESCENE478_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Are you questioning her holiness?!
1045107216405,DIALOGUESCENE478_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Can you please just stay out of this?
1045107216406,DIALOGUESCENE478_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,"The gods have guided me to this place, so I'm certain that the group we're following is nearby."
1045107216407,DIALOGUESCENE478_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Damn. I hoped we would find them first before we got this far. The tundra is an unforgiving place.
1045107216408,DIALOGUESCENE478_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,But I guess we have no choice now. 
1045107216409,DIALOGUESCENE478_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,We should hurry. If we take too long who knows what might happen to the captives.
1045107216410,DIALOGUESCENE478_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE11,"I agree, Guild Master."
1045107216411,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen><?whiteFlash>Yo, Guild Master!"
1045107216412,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Oh, hello Bai."
1045107216413,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE3,I wanted to talk to you.
1045107216414,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE4,I was hoping you could do me a solid.
1045107216415,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...I'm afraid to ask but what do you want?
1045107216416,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE6,Have you heard of the wandering swordsman?
1045107216417,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Doesn't really ring a bell.
1045107216418,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE8,Really? He's all everyone is talking about here.
1045107216419,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE9,You really need to come to the tavern more often.
1045107216420,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,(You need to go less.)
1045107216421,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE11,"Anyway, it's some guy who has been popping up recently and challenging anybody who is somehow famed for their sword skill."
1045107216422,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE12,And he won every single time! He supposedly beat some really big names out there.
1045107216423,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Like who?
1045107216424,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE14,I dunno. They lost so why remember their names?
1045107216425,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE15,"Anyway, they say that he might be the greatest swordsman alive and there are rumors that he's currently somewhere nearby."
1045107216426,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,And you want to....?
1045107216427,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE17,<?shakeScreen>Challenge him of course!
1045107216428,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,...But you're not a swordsfighter.
1045107216429,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE19,Who cares? It's actually exactly how I want it to be.
1045107216430,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE20,If I can beat up the greatest swordsman then I can finally prove that fists are better than swords!
1045107216431,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,Alright...and what's it that you wanted from me?
1045107216432,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE22,I wanted to ask if I could bring some of the adventurers with me. They might learn one or two things from my fight with the guy.
1045107216433,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,...
1045107216434,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,"...So to recap: You want to take some adventurers with you, so they can see you beat up some stranger?"
1045107216435,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE25,I guess that's the gist of it.
1045107216436,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE26,...
1045107216437,DIALOGUESCENE479_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,"...<?whiteFlash>Sure, why not? Knock yourself out. Have fun."
1045107216438,DIALOGUESCENE479_BAI_DIALOGUE28,"Thanks, Guild Master!"
1045107216439,DIALOGUESCENE480_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Oh, Bai. You're back."
1045107216440,DIALOGUESCENE480_BAI_DIALOGUE2,"I am, and I brought a new mouth to feed."
1045107216441,DIALOGUESCENE480_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,You what?
1045107216442,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE1,...So this is the Adventurer Guild.
1045107216443,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE2,"I've heard about it before, but it's less impressive than I thought."
1045107216444,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE3,And this is?
1045107216445,DIALOGUESCENE481_BAI_DIALOGUE4,This is the Guild Master.
1045107216446,DIALOGUESCENE481_BAI_DIALOGUE5,"Guild Master, this is Shen."
1045107216447,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE6,...*Touch*
1045107216448,DIALOGUESCENE481_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>W-What the heck!! Why are you touching me there?!
1045107216449,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE8,I wasn't sure whether you were a man or a woman.
1045107216450,DIALOGUESCENE481_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,What's with you and your village that keeps touching people to ascertain their gender?
1045107216451,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE10,"Well, it doesn't really matter. "
1045107216452,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE11," Rejoice, Guild Master! The greatest swordmaster in the world has decided to join your humble guild."
1045107216453,DIALOGUESCENE481_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,...You're asking to join us?
1045107216454,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE13,Oh no! I'm not asking. I'm just telling you what's happening.
1045107216455,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE14,"As long as Bai wants to stay here, I will too."
1045107216456,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE15,She said she was instructing people. Then I will do the same.
1045107216457,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE16,"What she can do, I can do better!"
1045107216458,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE17,"However, unlike the crude techniques of the Rising Sun Fist  Style, the techniques of the Azure Blade style is much harder to master!"
1045107216459,DIALOGUESCENE481_BAI_DIALOGUE18,"So, that's what my style was called again!"
1045107216460,DIALOGUESCENE481_BAI_DIALOGUE19,...Still sounds dumb.
1045107216461,DIALOGUESCENE481_SHEN_DIALOGUE20,"I will only be able to teach a single person at a time. However, that person will learn the Azure Blade style and be as effective as ten of Bai's disciples."
1045107216462,DIALOGUESCENE482_SHEN_DIALOGUE1,As you can see there is no reason to refuse even if you could.
1045107216463,DIALOGUESCENE482_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"...
Will you still be wearing the mask while you're here?"
1045107216464,DIALOGUESCENE482_SHEN_DIALOGUE3,<?whiteFlash>...Why? Is the mask a problem?
1045107216465,DIALOGUESCENE483_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>A big one!
1045107216466,DIALOGUESCENE483_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>I'm sick and tired of all these people who wear masks around me.
1045107216467,DIALOGUESCENE483_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Is Shen even your real name?
1045107216468,DIALOGUESCENE483_SHEN_DIALOGUE4,"Well, technically it...isn't."
1045107216469,DIALOGUESCENE483_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...Take it off.
1045107216470,DIALOGUESCENE483_SHEN_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>W-what?
1045107216471,DIALOGUESCENE483_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>I said take it off!
1045107216472,DIALOGUESCENE483_SHEN_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>W-wait! <?shakeScreeen>What are you doing?<?fadeOutNPC><?shakeScreen> Stop it!
1045107216473,DIALOGUESCENE484_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>!!!!
1045107216474,DIALOGUESCENE484_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(Oh no! He's hot!)
1045107216475,DIALOGUESCENE484_YU_DIALOGUE3,C-can I have my mask back? P-please?
1045107216476,DIALOGUESCENE484_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>You suddenly seem different now.
1045107216477,DIALOGUESCENE485_YU_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>I-I am sorry!!! I was r-rude, wasn't I?"
1045107216478,DIALOGUESCENE485_YU_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>I didn't mean to boast like that.
1045107216479,DIALOGUESCENE485_YU_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>A-and it was also terrible of m-me to touch you there!
1045107216480,DIALOGUESCENE485_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...What is happening here?
1045107216481,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE5,"Guild Master, let me introduce you to Yu. My childhood friend."
1045107216482,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE6,The person behind the mask.
1045107216483,DIALOGUESCENE485_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...I still don't understand.
1045107216484,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE8,"Let me demonstrate, Guild Master.
Can I have the mask?"
1045107216485,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE9,If I put the mask on him...
1045107216486,DIALOGUESCENE485_SHEN_DIALOGUE10,"<?whiteFlash>That was mighty brave of you, Guild Master, to take the mask of the man who could just kill you a hundred times over in a split of a second."
1045107216487,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE11,And if I take the mask off him...
1045107216488,DIALOGUESCENE485_YU_DIALOGUE12,<?whiteFlash>B-but I w-would never do that. I-I could never hurt anybody!
1045107216489,DIALOGUESCENE485_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Is the mask haunted?
1045107216490,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE14,"No, it's worse than that."
1045107216491,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE15,"Little Yu here is the heir to the Azure Blade style, but despite his talents, he never did well during his training."
1045107216492,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE16,"He was too timid and lacked any kind of self-confidence, usually getting beaten by people who were weaker than him."
1045107216493,DIALOGUESCENE485_BAI_DIALOGUE17,"Eventually, his parents got the idea to brainwash him. Now, every time he puts this stupid mask on, he believes himself to be Shen, an arrogant swordmaster with self-confidence enough for ten people."
1045107216494,DIALOGUESCENE485_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"...So I guess, just teaching their kid some self-confidence was too easy, was it? Had to skip right over to brainwashing."
1045107216495,DIALOGUESCENE486_YU_DIALOGUE1,C-can I have the mask back? I-I think Shen would contribute better to the conversation.
1045107216496,DIALOGUESCENE486_BAI_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>Damn it, Yu! Just leave the mask off for a bit. How long has it been since you've been just you?"
1045107216497,DIALOGUESCENE486_YU_DIALOGUE3,...
1045107216498,DIALOGUESCENE486_BAI_DIALOGUE4,"It's been a while since we last saw each other, hasn't it?"
1045107216499,DIALOGUESCENE486_BAI_DIALOGUE5,How about we go drink together tonight?
1045107216500,DIALOGUESCENE486_YU_DIALOGUE6,...I...
1045107216501,DIALOGUESCENE487_YU_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>I WANT MY MASK BACK!
1045107216502,DIALOGUESCENE487_YU_DIALOGUE2,"<?shakeScreen>G-GIVE IT BACK, BAI!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045107216503,DIALOGUESCENE487_BAI_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>W-what? WHY?
1045107216504,DIALOGUESCENE487_YU_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>J-JUST GIVE IT BACK!
1045107216505,DIALOGUESCENE487_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...Great. Another oddball joined us.
1045107216506,DIALOGUESCENE487_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,*Sighs*I guess at this point one more makes no difference.
1045107216507,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,"Hello, Guild Master!"
1045107216508,DIALOGUESCENE488_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"<?whiteFlash>Oh, hello...eh...
"
1045107216509,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,"...You forgot my name, didn't you?"
1045107216510,DIALOGUESCENE488_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I...uh...
1045107216511,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Just forget it!
1045107216512,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE6,There is something else I wanted to tell you.
1045107216513,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE7,Some courier came by and just left this letter to me. I thought it might be for you.
1045107216514,DIALOGUESCENE488_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Let me see...
1045107216515,DIALOGUESCENE488_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,<?whiteFlash>...This is addressed to Falken.
1045107216516,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE10,"Really? Can't read, so really couldn't tell."
1045107216517,DIALOGUESCENE488_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,You can't read?
1045107216518,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE12,"<?shakeScreen>And you can't remember names! So, we're not all perfect, okay?"
1045107216519,DIALOGUESCENE488_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,(Perhaps I should offer some reading classes in the Guild.)
1045107216520,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE14,Should I take this over to Falken then?
1045107216521,DIALOGUESCENE488_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,No need. I'll take care of it.
1045107216522,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE16,"Alright, then."
1045107216523,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE17,...
1045107216524,DIALOGUESCENE488_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,...Is there something else?
1045107216525,DIALOGUESCENE488_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE19,<?shakeScreen>You still didn't ask me my name!
1045107216526,DIALOGUESCENE489_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Hey, Falken!"
1045107216527,DIALOGUESCENE489_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"Oh! Hello, Guild Master! What is it?"
1045107216528,DIALOGUESCENE489_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"I wanted to deliver some great news, but where is Astrid? She needs to hear this too."
1045107216529,DIALOGUESCENE489_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,I'm here. I had a feeling that the adventurers had done it!
1045107216530,DIALOGUESCENE489_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,Done what?
1045107216531,DIALOGUESCENE489_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I've sent some adventurers to participate in the grand tournament in Cragmond.
1045107216532,DIALOGUESCENE489_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,And they've won it!
1045107216533,DIALOGUESCENE489_ASTRID_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>Heck yeah! That's what I'm talking about! I hope they really put those people from Talon's Fury down!
1045107216534,DIALOGUESCENE489_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,Talon's Fury? You mean my old comrades? Is this what this is all about?
1045107216535,DIALOGUESCENE489_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Well... yeah. We thought it would be nice to get them back for harassing you.
1045107216536,DIALOGUESCENE490_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,...You really didn't have to do that.
1045107216537,DIALOGUESCENE490_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>What do you mean? They deserved it for constantly mocking you with their tournament invitations.
1045107216538,DIALOGUESCENE490_ASTRID_DIALOGUE3,They knew exactly how much it meant to you!
1045107216539,DIALOGUESCENE490_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"...
"
1045107216540,DIALOGUESCENE490_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,"Truth is, I deserve it."
1045107216541,DIALOGUESCENE490_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>What?
1045107216542,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,"Guild Master. I tried to hide it, but we once met each other when I was still the Black Falcon. Do you remember?"
1045107216543,DIALOGUESCENE491_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,I remember meeting the 'Black Falcon' but you've really changed to the point I didn't recognize you. I mean all that black leather you were wearing.
1045107216544,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"<?shakeScreen>W-well, that's another thing completely. "
1045107216545,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,"But besides that. Tell me, what was your impression of me?"
1045107216546,DIALOGUESCENE491_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,... Let me think. It was so long ago... But if I recall...
1045107216547,DIALOGUESCENE491_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>Oh...
1045111410688,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"Yeah, I was a bastard."
1045111410689,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,"The kind you'd love to beat up, Astrid."
1045111410690,DIALOGUESCENE491_ASTRID_DIALOGUE9,...
1045111410691,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,"I was strong and famous at a young age, and more than once I let it all go to my head."
1045111410692,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,"If you thought I was insufferable, how bad do you think it was for my comrades? There is a reason why none of them ever got famous despite us accomplishing so much."
1045111410693,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,I downplayed every one of their achievements and belittled them in front of people wherever I could. I was a bully to the people who I should have cared for the most.
1045111410694,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE13,"The day I lost my leg was because I took a dangerous quest they all protested against. 
But I <b>forced</b> them to risk their lives for my fame."
1045111410695,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,Any of them could have become a cripple like me.
1045111410696,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15,Or even worse.
1045111410697,DIALOGUESCENE491_ASTRID_DIALOGUE16,... They still didn't have to harass you after such a long time. 
1045111410698,DIALOGUESCENE491_ASTRID_DIALOGUE17,...You don't deserve it.
1045111410699,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE18,...What's worse than a person doing bad things is a person who makes good people do bad things.
1045111410700,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE19, I deserve it.
1045111410701,DIALOGUESCENE491_FALKEN_DIALOGUE20,"And if it's just a letter every year, then I got off far too easily."
1045111410702,DIALOGUESCENE492_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045111410703,DIALOGUESCENE492_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>Maybe you should talk with them?
1045111410704,DIALOGUESCENE492_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>T-Talk with them?
1045111410705,DIALOGUESCENE492_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4, I... I don't know if I can. I'm too ashamed to face them after all this time.
1045111410706,DIALOGUESCENE492_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,And I'm sure they don't even want to see me.
1045111410707,DIALOGUESCENE493_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Maybe they do.
1045111410708,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,Huh?
1045111410709,DIALOGUESCENE493_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,There is another possible interpretation for the invitation. It could mean 'We're here. Come if you want to see us.'
1045111410710,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,...
1045111410711,DIALOGUESCENE493_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,They might still be in Cragmond. It still might be possible to meet them.
1045111410712,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,...I-I don't know.
1045111410713,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"It's laughable, isn't it? I used to face monsters on a daily basis but this somehow scares me more."
1045111410714,DIALOGUESCENE493_ASTRID_DIALOGUE8,I'll come with you.
1045111410715,DIALOGUESCENE493_ASTRID_DIALOGUE9,"If any of them tries to make a scene, I'll crack their heads open."
1045111410716,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,Astrid...
1045111410717,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,...
1045111410718,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreen>Alright! You've convinced me. I'll go to Cragmond immediately!
1045111410719,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE13,I'll ask them for their forgiveness and try to make amends.
1045111410720,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,"<?shakeScreen>Let's go, Astrid!"
1045111410721,DIALOGUESCENE493_ASTRID_DIALOGUE15,I'm right behind you.
1045111410722,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE16,And Guild Master..
1045111410723,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE17,<?whiteFlash>No... {PROTAGONIST}...
1045111410724,DIALOGUESCENE493_FALKEN_DIALOGUE18,Thank you!
1045111410725,DIALOGUESCENE493_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,"...I wish you luck, Falken."
1045111410726,DIALOGUESCENE494_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Now remember the form I taught you all and start swinging.
1045111410727,DIALOGUESCENE494_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(It seems like Falken is busy training some adventurers.)
1045111410728,DIALOGUESCENE494_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,<?whiteFlash>Oh! Guild Master!
1045111410729,DIALOGUESCENE494_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,What are you doing here?
1045111410730,DIALOGUESCENE494_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I needed to talk with you. Is this a bad moment?
1045111410731,DIALOGUESCENE494_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,"No, it's alright."
1045111410732,DIALOGUESCENE494_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>Everyone!
1045111410733,DIALOGUESCENE494_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,"Just because the Guild Master is here, doesn't mean you can slack off!"
1045111410734,DIALOGUESCENE494_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,I want you to keep swinging your practice swords until your arms fall off!
1045111410735,DIALOGUESCENE494_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE10,Ugh....
1045111410736,DIALOGUESCENE494_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE11,I don't even use swords!
1045111410737,DIALOGUESCENE494_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,"Now that should keep them busy for a while. How can I help you, Guild Master?"
1045111410738,DIALOGUESCENE494_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"Actually, I have something for you."
1045111410739,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,A letter arrived that is addressed to you.
1045111410740,DIALOGUESCENE495_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,<?whiteFlash>...Is it that time of the year already?
1045111410741,DIALOGUESCENE495_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,*Sighs* You can throw it away if you wish.
1045111410742,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,What? Are you sure?
1045111410743,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Don't you want to at least read it?
1045111410744,DIALOGUESCENE495_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,No. It's the same letter every year.
1045111410745,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,<?whiteFlash>The same letter every year?
1045111410746,DIALOGUESCENE495_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,"Don't worry about it, Guild Master. It's nothing, really."
1045111410747,DIALOGUESCENE495_FALKEN_DIALOGUE9,"Just throw it away for me, will you?"
1045111410748,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"Well, if you say so."
1045111410749,DIALOGUESCENE495_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,"Thank you, Guild Master. Now I better get back to my adventurers. "
1045111410750,DIALOGUESCENE495_FALKEN_DIALOGUE12,They probably already miss me.<?fadeOutNPC>
1045111410751,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,...
1045111410752,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,(Opens the letter).
1045111410753,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,A tournament invitation?
1045111410754,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE16,<?whiteFlash>Is it another letter from those bastards again?
1045111410755,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,<?shakeScreen>!!!
1045111410756,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,Astrid! Where did you come from?
1045111410757,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE19, I just saw you talking with Falken and that letter you were carrying.
1045111410758,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE20,"Considering the time of the year, I knew immediately from whom it is."
1045111410759,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE21,If I ever get my hands on them...
1045111410760,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,From whom is this letter?
1045111410761,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE23, ...Falken's former Adventurer Party.
1045111410762,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE24,"...From when he was still an adventurer.
"
1045111410763,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE25,Really? Why would they send him a tournament invitation?
1045111410764,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE26,It is a taunt! 
1045111410765,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE27,"Every year these bastards send Falken an invitation to the yearly grand tournament in Cragmond, knowing full well he can't participate."
1045111410766,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE28,"He used to win that tournament every year with his former party, but of course, after his injury, he had to retire."
1045111410767,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE29,Every year? That's quite the achievement.
1045111410768,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE30,Didn't you know? Falken used to be quite the bigshot back in the days.
1045111410769,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE31,"He used to be called the ""Black Falcon."""
1045111410770,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE32,"<?shakeScreen>He is the ""Black Falcon""?! He?!"
1045111410771,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE33,One of the few adventurers who were actually famous and respected?
1045111410772,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE34,...I would have never guessed.
1045111410773,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE35,"I met the guy once, and he seemed like a very different person!"
1045111410774,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE36,"I didn't believe it myself at first, too, but believe me. He's the real deal."
1045111410775,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE37,...So why would his former teammates send him a letter every year just to taunt him?
1045111410776,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE38,"Do you remember any names besides the ""Black Falcon"" from his party?"
1045111410777,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE39,...Not really.
1045111410778,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE40,That's how much he overshadowed everyone else in the party. It's no wonder they were jealous of him
1045111410779,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE41,"Now that he can't fight back, they just enjoy kicking him while he's on the ground."
1045111410780,DIALOGUESCENE495_ASTRID_DIALOGUE42,Spineless bastards...
1045111410781,DIALOGUESCENE495_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE43,That's low.
1045111410782,DIALOGUESCENE496_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>You know what, Guild Master? We should do something!"
1045111410783,DIALOGUESCENE496_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What did you have in mind?
1045111410784,DIALOGUESCENE496_ASTRID_DIALOGUE3,"Even after Falken left the party, they manage to win it every year. How about we send our adventurers to that tournament and win it ourselves?"
1045111410785,DIALOGUESCENE496_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,Let our adventurers put them in their place and show them that even Falken's trainees are better than them.
1045111410786,DIALOGUESCENE496_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I do not dislike that idea. It would be also a great way to spread the Guild's name.
1045111410787,DIALOGUESCENE496_ASTRID_DIALOGUE6,Great!
1045111410788,DIALOGUESCENE496_ASTRID_DIALOGUE7,I would have preferred a more violent solution but this will have to suffice.
1045111410789,DIALOGUESCENE497_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,I have to say that I rarely met bandits myself most of my life.
1045111410790,DIALOGUESCENE497_LUANA_DIALOGUE2,There was one time where the order was sent out to destroy a group of bandits that has made the mistake of robbing merchants affiliated with the king.
1045111410791,DIALOGUESCENE497_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,What happened that day couldn't even be considered a fight.
1045111410792,DIALOGUESCENE497_LUANA_DIALOGUE4,"But most of the time, bandits were rarely an occurence for me."
1045111410793,DIALOGUESCENE497_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I guess bandits know better than to mess with the powerful people. 
1045111410794,DIALOGUESCENE497_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Not much consolation for everyone else.
1045111410795,DIALOGUESCENE498_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,I've heard adventurers who seemingly mocked the title and thought nothing of it.
1045111410796,DIALOGUESCENE498_LUANA_DIALOGUE2,"However, I would be wary of anyone with a title like that, Guild Master."
1045111410797,DIALOGUESCENE498_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,I've seen how people react to it. It would be unwise to underestimate someone with a title with this much weight behind it.
1045111410798,DIALOGUESCENE499_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,"I've heard of the Divine Messenger, although I've never seen her."
1045111410799,DIALOGUESCENE499_LUANA_DIALOGUE2,In fact most people have never seen her. Not for a lack of trying.
1045111410800,DIALOGUESCENE499_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,"In my time as part of the Crown Order, I remember the king trying several times to seek an audience with her."
1045111410801,DIALOGUESCENE499_LUANA_DIALOGUE4,Every time he was refused.
1045111410802,DIALOGUESCENE499_LUANA_DIALOGUE5,"Considering that, it's rather strange that she would decide to meet the leader of an organization so far below her."
1045111410803,DIALOGUESCENE499_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...
1045111410804,DIALOGUESCENE499_LUANA_DIALOGUE7,"...Ah, right! No offense, Guild Master."
1045111410805,DIALOGUESCENE499_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Some taken.
1045111410806,DIALOGUESCENE500_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,The way the gods handle the issue with the witch reminds me of my time with the Crown Order.
1045111410807,DIALOGUESCENE500_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,In what way?
1045111410808,DIALOGUESCENE500_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,There were also often times where we were sent on missions with no knowledge of their purpose.
1045111410809,DIALOGUESCENE500_LUANA_DIALOGUE4,"Usually when that happens, it means that there is some dirty secret somebody does not want anyone to know of."
1045111410810,DIALOGUESCENE500_LUANA_DIALOGUE5,"If that's the case, I can only advise you to be careful, Guild Master. Some secrets are better left unknown if you want to live long."
1045111410811,DIALOGUESCENE500_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"...I'll try to keep that in mind, Luana."
1045111410812,DIALOGUESCENE501_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,"Have a good day, Guild Master."
1045111410813,DIALOGUESCENE502_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,"Greetings, Guild Master."
1045111410814,DIALOGUESCENE503_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So is Luana your real name?
1045111410815,DIALOGUESCENE503_LUANA_DIALOGUE2,It's my parent's given name if that's what you're asking.
1045111410816,DIALOGUESCENE503_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Oh good. Nothing to worry about in that regard then.
1045111410817,DIALOGUESCENE503_LUANA_DIALOGUE4,?
1045111410818,DIALOGUESCENE503_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,I was just considering the possibility that Rogue might have told you to give me a fake name.
1045111410819,DIALOGUESCENE503_LUANA_DIALOGUE6,I can see her doing that.
1045111410820,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I have to say that from your look and behaviour you seem to be very different from Rogue.
1045111410821,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Are you affiliated to ""them"" like her?"
1045111410822,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,"No, I'm not, Guild Master."
1045111410823,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE4,"To tell the truth, I myself do not know much of ""they"" other that ""they"" call themselves ""The Hand""."
1045111410824,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"(Well, at least now I don't have to call them ""they"" anymore.)"
1045111410825,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE6,Rogue herself won't tell me anything. She says that any knowledge I gain would only put me in danger.
1045111410826,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE7,It's kinda cute how much she worries.
1045111410827,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"(She has been acting ""cuter"" since you got here.)"
1045111410828,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,So what's your affiliation then?
1045111410829,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE10,"I am, or better I was, part of The Crown Order."
1045111410830,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,The Crown Order? Isn't that the chivalric order founded by the King to gather the best knights in the country?
1045111410831,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE12,"Yes, it is."
1045111410832,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Then that also means you're a...
1045111410833,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE14,"A noble, yes."
1045111410834,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE15,My full name is Luana Moonguard.
1045111410835,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,"...So, not even lower nobility. Even I have heard of the Moonguard family."
1045111410836,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"(You really have a high-class friend here, Rogue)."
1045111410837,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE18,"You don't have to feel uncomfortable around me, Guildmaster."
1045111410838,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE19,"None of that matters anymore, since I lost my position in the Order. I have no titles anymore."
1045111410839,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,What about your family?
1045111410840,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE21,I was dishonorably discharged.
1045111410841,DIALOGUESCENE504_LUANA_DIALOGUE22,"To them, I'm already dead."
1045111410842,DIALOGUESCENE504_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE23,I see...
1045111410843,DIALOGUESCENE505_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,(I think I noticed a pattern.)
1045111410844,DIALOGUESCENE505_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"So, about Rogue..."
1045111410845,DIALOGUESCENE505_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,Yeah?
1045111410846,DIALOGUESCENE505_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Nevermind.
1045111410847,DIALOGUESCENE505_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Oh.
1045111410848,DIALOGUESCENE505_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,But that reminds me what Rogue once said...
1045111410849,DIALOGUESCENE505_LUANA_DIALOGUE7,What did she say?
1045111410850,DIALOGUESCENE505_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...I can't remember.
1045111410851,DIALOGUESCENE505_LUANA_DIALOGUE9,I see.
1045111410852,DIALOGUESCENE505_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,(I should try this with Rogue too.)
1045111410853,DIALOGUESCENE506_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,Is there more you'd like to discuss?
1045115604992,DIALOGUESCENE507_LUANA_DIALOGUE1,"Lately, Rogue has been avoiding me."
1045115604993,DIALOGUESCENE507_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,I think she still just feels a bit embarassed after what you said last time.
1045115604994,DIALOGUESCENE507_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,What do you mean?
1045115604995,DIALOGUESCENE507_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"You know, the whole ""Whatever may come, I'll be with you.""
It kinda sounded like you intend to stay by her side for the rest of your life."
1045115604996,DIALOGUESCENE507_LUANA_DIALOGUE5,I do.
1045115604997,DIALOGUESCENE507_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Oh, I see."
1045115604998,DIALOGUESCENE507_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Then you better grab onto her and never let go.
1045115604999,DIALOGUESCENE507_LUANA_DIALOGUE8,...I think I'll do that. <?fadeOutNPC>
1045115605000,DIALOGUESCENE507_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...<?shakeScreen>W-wait! Luana! I meant figuratively!
1045115605001,DIALOGUESCENE508_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,It looks to me like you and Rogue live in two different worlds.
1045115605002,DIALOGUESCENE508_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,How did you two meet each other and what's your relationship?
1045115605003,DIALOGUESCENE508_LUANA_DIALOGUE3,...
1045115605004,DIALOGUESCENE508_LUANA_DIALOGUE4,...I'm sorry Guild Master.
1045115605005,DIALOGUESCENE508_LUANA_DIALOGUE5,...I'm not sure if Rogue would be fine with me sharing that story.
1045115605006,DIALOGUESCENE508_LUANA_DIALOGUE6,"If you really want to know, try asking her."
1045115605007,DIALOGUESCENE508_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,(That probably won't be easy.)
1045115605008,DIALOGUESCENE508_LUANA_DIALOGUE8,"I can only say that the first time I met her,..."
1045115605009,DIALOGUESCENE508_LUANA_DIALOGUE9,...it was the best day in my life.
1045115605010,DIALOGUESCENE509_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,"Bandits, nothing more than unskilled trash that live from the work of others."
1045115605011,DIALOGUESCENE509_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,Killing them were one of the few good things adventurers used to do.
1045115605012,DIALOGUESCENE509_ASTRID_DIALOGUE3,I once had an argument with my old party because they wanted to negotiate with bandits.
1045115605013,DIALOGUESCENE509_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,I gave my opinion on that matter by simply putting arrows through the bandits' skulls.
1045115605014,DIALOGUESCENE509_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045115605015,DIALOGUESCENE509_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...Dear gods...
1045115605016,DIALOGUESCENE510_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,"""The Bandit King"". What a load of bullshit! "
1045115605017,DIALOGUESCENE510_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,He could as well call himself the king of trash and it would make no differences.
1045115605018,DIALOGUESCENE510_ASTRID_DIALOGUE3,"I hope his next title starts with ""The dead...""."
1045115605019,DIALOGUESCENE511_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,Just another disappointing person.
1045115605020,DIALOGUESCENE511_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,"You'd think somebody called the ""Divine Messenger"" would have morals that stands above others."
1045115605021,DIALOGUESCENE511_ASTRID_DIALOGUE3,But I was completely mistaken.
1045115605022,DIALOGUESCENE512_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,...
1045115605023,DIALOGUESCENE512_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,Nothing good comes out of talking about it...
1045115605024,DIALOGUESCENE512_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,<?whiteFlash>...Wait. 
1045115605025,DIALOGUESCENE512_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Is that why you didn't want to talk about your former...
1045115605026,DIALOGUESCENE512_ASTRID_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!
1045115605027,DIALOGUESCENE512_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...
1045115605028,DIALOGUESCENE513_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,I don't see any point in having her in the dungeon.
1045115605029,DIALOGUESCENE513_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,If it were up to me there would be already arrows sticking out of her skull.
1045115605030,DIALOGUESCENE513_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Please, don't do anything stupid.
There's still a lot I need to ask her."
1045115605031,DIALOGUESCENE513_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,If you think that'll help.
1045115605032,DIALOGUESCENE514_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Have you been with the Adventurer Guild for long, Astrid?"
1045115605033,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,Is this supposed to be a social conversation? Don't waste both of our times!
1045115605034,DIALOGUESCENE514_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"For better or worse I'm the Guild Master, here. I should know the people working for me."
1045115605035,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,Do you honestly even care?
1045115605036,DIALOGUESCENE514_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"I do.
I care because Fran would have cared."
1045115605037,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE6,...Fine...
1045115605038,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE7,I actually started here as an adventurer when the Guild was still in its infancy.
1045115605039,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE8,"Honestly, at first I had no intention to join the Guild."
1045115605040,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE9,I was already an adventurer at that time for some years and I already know how many of them really are.
1045115605041,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE10,I could only imagine the Guild as a hotpot of thugs and ruffians.
1045115605042,DIALOGUESCENE514_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,Why did you change your mind then?
1045115605043,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE12,...I had a falling out with my own adventuring party at that time.
1045115605044,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE13,"They wanted to do a Quest I simply couldn't agree to, so we went our seperate ways."
1045115605045,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE14,It wasn't until much later I heard that things went wrong for them during that Quest and they all ended up dead.
1045115605046,DIALOGUESCENE514_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,I'm sorry to hear that.
1045115605047,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE16,Don't be. They were bastards and deserved to die.
1045115605048,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE17,The only reason I worked with them was because I didn't think they would stoop so low.
1045115605049,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE18,"I was actually thinking about returning and killing them in their sleep, myself!"
1045115605050,DIALOGUESCENE514_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,(...Whoa...)
1045115605051,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE20,"In any case, an adventurer without a party was just more likely to end up dead than one with. But it wasn't easy to find another party."
1045115605052,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE21,"In the end, it felt like I had no choice but to check out the Guild if I wanted to improve my survival chance."
1045115605053,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE22,"As it turned out, the Guild was actually different than I thought and I ended up in a party I could work with."
1045115605054,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE23,I did Quests for the Adventurer Guild for many years but it ended when I lost my eye.
1045115605055,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE24,"After that...incident, the previous Guild Master offered me a job as an instructor and I accepted."
1045115605056,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE25,"Now, we're here."
1045115605057,DIALOGUESCENE514_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE26,"And what happened to your old Adventuring Party, after you stopped?"
1045115605058,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE27,...
1045115605059,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE28,I do not want to talk about them!
1045115605060,DIALOGUESCENE514_ASTRID_DIALOGUE29,Don't ever ask me about them again!
1045115605061,DIALOGUESCENE514_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE30,...
1045115605062,DIALOGUESCENE515_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,Need something?
1045115605063,DIALOGUESCENE516_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So...about you and Falken...
1045115605064,DIALOGUESCENE516_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,Huh? Don't tell me you have been eavesdropping!
1045115605065,DIALOGUESCENE516_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>I-it wasn't on purpose! I just wanted to make sure nothing happened.
1045115605066,DIALOGUESCENE516_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,...What do you want?
1045115605067,DIALOGUESCENE516_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Nothing! I just thought it was weird that you blew him off because I was sure that you...also had some feelings for him.
1045115605068,DIALOGUESCENE516_ASTRID_DIALOGUE6,It won't work.
1045115605069,DIALOGUESCENE516_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Why would you think that?
1045115605070,DIALOGUESCENE516_ASTRID_DIALOGUE8,"<?shakeScreen>I know very well that I'm difficult! 
<?shakeScreen>I-I just can't help it! There is so much anger in me and I don't know where to direct it!"
1045115605071,DIALOGUESCENE516_ASTRID_DIALOGUE9,...I don't want to direct it at Falken.
1045115605072,DIALOGUESCENE516_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,...But do you like him?
1045115605073,DIALOGUESCENE516_ASTRID_DIALOGUE11,...I don't hate him.
1045115605074,DIALOGUESCENE516_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,(Rejoice Falken! There might be hope for you yet.)
1045115605075,DIALOGUESCENE517_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,If you say so.
1045115605076,DIALOGUESCENE518_ASTRID_DIALOGUE1,Anything else?
1045115605077,DIALOGUESCENE519_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045115605078,DIALOGUESCENE519_ASTRID_DIALOGUE2,"Gods, damn it! How often do I have to tell you?
That's not how you shoot an arrow!"
1045115605079,DIALOGUESCENE519_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,"<?shakeScreen>I-I'm s-sorry, m'aam!"
1045115605080,DIALOGUESCENE519_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,Hold it like this! Now try it again!
1045115605081,DIALOGUESCENE519_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,Y-yes! <?fadeOutNPC>
1045115605082,DIALOGUESCENE519_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(Whoosh....the arrow missed the target by a mile...)
1045115605083,DIALOGUESCENE519_ASTRID_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen><b>Are you trying to piss me off?
1045115605084,DIALOGUESCENE519_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE8,"<?shakeScreen>Yikes! N-No, m'aam!"
1045115605085,DIALOGUESCENE519_ASTRID_DIALOGUE9,Do you like kittens?
1045115605086,DIALOGUESCENE519_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,W-what?
1045115605087,DIALOGUESCENE519_ASTRID_DIALOGUE11,<?shakeScreen><b>I SAID: DO YOU LIKE KITTENS!!!
1045115605088,DIALOGUESCENE519_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreen>Y-YES! V-VERY MUCH SO!!

1045115605092,DIALOGUESCENE519_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,(...)
1045115605093,DIALOGUESCENE519_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,(Dear gods...)
1045115605094,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>Whoa there! I think this is enough training for today!
1045115605095,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,How about we just call it a day and continue tomorrow?
1045115605096,DIALOGUESCENE520_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,"Y-yes! Thank you, sir!<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045115605097,DIALOGUESCENE520_ASTRID_DIALOGUE4,Hmph! Look at how fast she can run when it's not laps around the field.
1045115605098,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,Astrid...how often have I told you that it would be better if you were just a little bit nicer to the adventurers?
1045115605099,DIALOGUESCENE520_ASTRID_DIALOGUE6,I think I was perfectly reasonable.
1045115605100,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,...Really?
1045115605101,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,The whole kitten thing was reasonable? Did you even hear yourself?
1045115605102,DIALOGUESCENE520_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Hey Falken...
1045115605103,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE10,"<?whiteFlash>Oh, Guild Master!"
1045115605104,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,"You saw all that, huh?"
1045115605105,DIALOGUESCENE520_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Pretty much.
1045115605106,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE13,*sigh*...I don't think you two have met yet. Guild Master; let me introduce you to Astrid. The Archer Instructor.
1045115605107,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,Astrid; this is the new Guild Master of the Adventurer Guild.
1045115605108,DIALOGUESCENE520_ASTRID_DIALOGUE15,Are you also here to tell me how to do my job?
1045115605109,DIALOGUESCENE520_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,Normally I wouldn't...
1045115605110,DIALOGUESCENE520_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"...but, I do think threatening to take kittens as hostages...goes a bit too far."
1045115605111,DIALOGUESCENE520_ASTRID_DIALOGUE18,...Fine! I won't take kittens as hostages.
1045115605112,DIALOGUESCENE520_FALKEN_DIALOGUE19,...I would have never thought that something like that was even on the table.
1045115605113,DIALOGUESCENE521_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,Ah bandits. The perfect antagonists to the start of any hero's journey.
1045115605114,DIALOGUESCENE521_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,This could be very well the opening act of the glorious story of the Adventurer Guild's rise to fame.
1045115605115,DIALOGUESCENE521_VINCENT _DIALOGUE3,Ah! I already have a wonderful title in my mind! I need to write it down fast!
1045115605116,DIALOGUESCENE521_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...This is the most upbeat reaction I got from the bandit situation yet.
1045115605117,DIALOGUESCENE522_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"Oh, the Bandit King! What a wonderful antagonist for the Adventurers' Guild. A man whose cruelty knows no bounds, and only the heroes from the Adventurers' Guild can stop his dastardly plans!"
1045115605118,DIALOGUESCENE522_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...What plans? He's a bandit...
1045115605119,DIALOGUESCENE523_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>Shush, Guild Master! Inspiration has hit me! "
1045115605120,DIALOGUESCENE523_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,"In a land of danger and strife,
A bandit king ruled with an iron life.
His cruelty knew no bounds,
And his tyranny weighed heavy on all around."
1045115605121,DIALOGUESCENE523_VINCENT _DIALOGUE3,"But the Guild of Adventurers came to the fore,
With bravery and skill, they vowed to restore,
The peace and justice that had been denied,
By the bandit king and his wicked pride."
1045115605122,DIALOGUESCENE523_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,"They send brave adventurers to the bandit king's lair,
The heroes found him ready, with his minions, to ensnare,
But they fought with all their might and main,
Until the bandit king was defeated, his power waned."
1045115605123,DIALOGUESCENE523_VINCENT _DIALOGUE5,"With the bandit king vanquished, the people rejoiced,
Their freedom and hope now fully voiced.
And the heroes returned, to a grateful land,
Their bravery and sacrifice forever etched in sand."
1045115605124,DIALOGUESCENE523_VINCENT _DIALOGUE6,"The Adventurer Guild first unbeknown,
now rose in fame, their valor shown.
Thus ends the first chapter of their story,
in their neverending quest for glory."
1045115605125,DIALOGUESCENE524_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,...
1045115605126,DIALOGUESCENE524_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,"So, what do you think, Guild Master?"
1045115605127,DIALOGUESCENE524_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"I guess, it wasn't bad. Just one thing I like to point out."
1045115605128,DIALOGUESCENE524_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,"Oh? And what is that, Guild Master?"
1045115605129,DIALOGUESCENE524_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>It probably won't be the Guild that deals with the Bandit King. There is already a subjugation force being formed to attack the bandits. It's very likely we won't have any part in it.
1045115605130,DIALOGUESCENE524_VINCENT _DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>W-wait you can't let that happen! How would my story sound when someone else besides the protagonists deals with the villains? It would be awful!
1045115605131,DIALOGUESCENE524_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Nothing we can do.
1045115605132,DIALOGUESCENE524_VINCENT _DIALOGUE8,"*Sighs* I guess, I'll just skip that part in my story."
1045115605133,DIALOGUESCENE524_VINCENT _DIALOGUE9,Can we talk about changing your name now?
1045115605134,DIALOGUESCENE524_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,No.
1045115605135,DIALOGUESCENE524_VINCENT _DIALOGUE11,<?shakeScreen>I just want so little!
1045115605136,DIALOGUESCENE525_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>The Divine Messenger?!
1045115605137,DIALOGUESCENE525_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,To think that the day would come where I might lay eyes on the Divine Messenger herself!
1045115605138,DIALOGUESCENE525_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,You seem awfully excited about it.
1045115605139,DIALOGUESCENE525_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen>Of course I am! How could you not?
1045115605140,DIALOGUESCENE525_VINCENT _DIALOGUE5,"She is the chosen of the gods! If there is any person, who could be considered a main character in life, then it would be her!"
1045115605141,DIALOGUESCENE525_VINCENT _DIALOGUE6,I need to prepare a song for her! Something fitting for a person of her stature.
1045115605142,DIALOGUESCENE525_VINCENT _DIALOGUE7,I know! I'll write a song that describes her transcending beauty and her infinite wisdom.
1045115605143,DIALOGUESCENE525_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Can you do that when you've never seen her?
1045115605144,DIALOGUESCENE525_VINCENT _DIALOGUE9,"Unimportant details, Guild Master!"
1045115605145,DIALOGUESCENE526_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"How marvelous! After defeating the dreaded Bandit King the Adventurer Guild has now subdued the Witch, a servant of the demon lords!"
1045115605146,DIALOGUESCENE526_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,With this my song about the Adventurer Guild is nearly complete!
1045115605147,DIALOGUESCENE526_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Nearly?
1045115605148,DIALOGUESCENE526_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,"<?shakeScreen>Of course!
I still need a third act! A third enemy the Guild can vanquish!"
1045115605149,DIALOGUESCENE526_VINCENT _DIALOGUE5,Something even grander than defeating the avatar of the demon lords!
1045115605150,DIALOGUESCENE526_VINCENT _DIALOGUE6,<?whiteFlash>I know! The Adventurer Guild needs to...
1045115605151,DIALOGUESCENE526_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"If you suggest challenging a demon lord, I might just have to smack you over the head."
1045115605152,DIALOGUESCENE526_VINCENT _DIALOGUE8,Fine...I won't suggest it.
1045119799296,DIALOGUESCENE527_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,I think you just gave me an inspiration for a song.
1045119799297,DIALOGUESCENE528_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"It's wonderful to meet you again, Guild Master!"
1045119799298,DIALOGUESCENE529_VINCENT _DIALOGUE1,"I'm still all ears, Guild Master!"
1045119799299,DIALOGUESCENE530_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"So if you wanted to write a story about the Adventurer Guild, why didn't you come when the Adventurer Guild was at their peak?"
1045119799300,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE2,"A wonderful question, Guild Master! Albeit, one that I can easily answer."
1045119799301,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE3,"When the Adventurer Guild was formed, the world was still a darker place for I still wasn't the bard I am today."
1045119799302,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE4,"By the time I finally was, the Guild was already known far and wide. And with that my opportunity was already gone."
1045119799303,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE5,There was simply no beauty in writing the story of the Adventurer Guild when I've never witnessed its ascendance.
1045119799304,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE6,Nor was I particularly interested in writing its downfall in the following years.
1045119799305,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE7,"But then I heard that out of nowhere, a new Guild Master has emerged to lead the Adventurer Guild once more. "
1045119799306,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE8,Every fiber of my being told me that the appearance of a new Guild Master was no mere coincidence.
1045119799307,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE9,"<?shakeScreen>No! It was fate. 
A sign from the gods that I was always meant to write an even better story:"
1045119799308,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE10,The resurgence of the Adventurer Guild!
1045119799309,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE11,And you my dear Guild Master will be the main character of it.
1045119799310,DIALOGUESCENE530_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,I'd rather if you leave me out of it.
1045119799311,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE13,"Oh, that's good! Modesty is a trait the audience will love!"
1045119799312,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE14,But we still have to do something about your name. Have you read my list with name suggestions yet?
1045119799313,DIALOGUESCENE530_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,I threw it away...
1045119799314,DIALOGUESCENE530_VINCENT _DIALOGUE16,"You were right to do that, Guild Master!
Because my second draft is even better!"
1045119799315,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I guess you're not really interested in guild affairs are you?
1045119799316,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,"To be precise, I do not have any interest in the Adventurer Guild at all."
1045119799317,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(That's a good start into the conversation...)
1045119799318,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,My main interest lies in the study of the ancient empire that preceded the nine kingdoms we know today.
1045119799319,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,Anything outside of that is of no concern of mine.
1045119799320,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Then how did you end up in the Adventurer Guild?
1045119799321,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,Are you asking out of curiosity or is this just a misguided attempt at a casual conversation?
1045119799322,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Just please answer the question...
1045119799323,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,Very well then. 
1045119799324,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE10,It was about five years ago when I came upon an ancient artifact that was sold by a simple merchant.
1045119799325,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE11,It was one I've never seen before and I asked the man where he found it.
1045119799326,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,He told that the Adventurer Guild has sold him the artifact and so I travelled to the Guild to see if they had more.
1045119799327,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE13,It would be an understatement to say that I was surprised when I saw the dozens of artifacts the Adventurers Guild had just lying around in their storage room.
1045119799328,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE14,"Apparently, adventurers are quite inclined to find such artifacts during their quests."
1045119799329,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,(I guess they do. I've also found severals during my time as an adventurer.)
1045119799330,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,"(They're usually hard to sell, so most of the time I threw them away.)"
1045119799331,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,(I probably shouldn't tell her that.)
1045119799332,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE18,It was then that I made an arrangement with the Guild Master at that time.
1045119799333,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE19,"While not as meaningful as my knowledge of the ancient empire, I was well versed in the practice of the arcane arts."
1045119799334,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE20,I offered to teach adventurers that knowledge and in exchange I would be the only one to whom the Guild could sell their artifacts to.
1045119799335,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE21,An agreement I hope you intend to keep Guild Master.
1045119799336,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,"I guess, I don't see anything wrong with that."
1045119799337,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE23,Wonderful. With that you also answered my only question for you.
1045119799338,DIALOGUESCENE531_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,...so you're saying that you're not interested in anything else about me.
1045119799339,DIALOGUESCENE531_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE25,It's refreshing to see that the current Guild Master is quite fast to grasp the situation.
1045119799340,DIALOGUESCENE532_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,A topic I very much lack an interest in. 
1045119799341,DIALOGUESCENE532_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,Banditry is just a common problem that has persisted throughout time and is proof of our inadequacies as a society.
1045119799342,DIALOGUESCENE532_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,"During the time of the ancient empire when human prosperity was at its' highest, the crime rate used to be accordingly low."
1045119799343,DIALOGUESCENE532_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,"Unfortunately, since the collapse none of the emergent kingdoms has managed to reach the level of law and order of the empire."
1045119799344,DIALOGUESCENE532_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,So....you're saying that everything used to be better in the old times?
1045119799345,DIALOGUESCENE532_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,Do not treat what I said as a jest. I was merely stating the facts.
1045119799346,DIALOGUESCENE533_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,A meaningless title for a man of little importance.
1045119799347,DIALOGUESCENE533_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,Whatever that man hopes to achieve with that kind of title won't come into fruition.
1045119799348,DIALOGUESCENE533_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,History has shown us kings that have suffered demise with a firmer foundation to stand upon.
1045119799349,DIALOGUESCENE534_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,I can say that she is a person of interest to me.
1045119799350,DIALOGUESCENE534_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,"I earnestly wish I could get an opportunity to speak with her. Or to be more precise, an opportunity to speak with the gods through her."
1045119799351,DIALOGUESCENE534_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,I feel like there are more fun conversation partners than gods.
1045119799352,DIALOGUESCENE534_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,*sighs* Of course it wouldn't be a conversation to exchange pleasantries.
1045119799353,DIALOGUESCENE534_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,"My primary focus lies in their profound understanding of the ancient empire, specifically their knowledge regarding the circumstances that led to its demise."
1045119799354,DIALOGUESCENE534_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Well, you're nothing but consistent."
1045119799355,DIALOGUESCENE535_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,"...I do not see myself as a fighter, Guild Master."
1045119799356,DIALOGUESCENE535_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,And that night made it painfully clear to me that I never want to be.
1045119799357,DIALOGUESCENE535_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,"It was the first and it will be the last time, I ever used magic against people."
1045119799358,DIALOGUESCENE536_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,It's fascinating to think there's a wellspring of knowledge about the ancient Empire so close by. If only she were more inclined to share it.
1045119799359,DIALOGUESCENE536_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,I guess you had no better luck since last time?
1045119799360,DIALOGUESCENE536_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,Regrettably not. It seems she is not even willing to acknowledge my existence whenever I visit her.
1045119799361,DIALOGUESCENE536_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,It's truly a shame.
1045119799362,DIALOGUESCENE537_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Why are you so interested in something that has been gone for so long?
1045119799363,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,My initial fascination with the empire was sparked by an educational lecture that I had attended during my younger years at the university.
1045119799364,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,The subject matter was of such enthralling nature that I found myself engaged in discussions with any academician possessing even a modicum of expertise in that area.
1045119799365,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,"It's remarkable how so many mysteries surrounding the empire continue to elude us to this day, despite leaving so many marks on the world."
1045119799366,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,"Even to this day, we still uncover remnants of the ancient empire in areas that has been long reclaimed by the forces of nature."
1045119799367,DIALOGUESCENE537_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(I guess I never really thought about where those ruins actually came from.)
1045119799368,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,"Merely based on that, it can be inferred that our current infrastructures fall short to even reach half the scale the ancient empire posessed."
1045119799369,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,"Ancient manuscripts reveal to us a society that has been thriving, an empire the size of which would dwarf any known kingdom today."
1045119799370,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,"And most astounding of all, it lasted more than a thousand years before it finally collapsed."
1045119799371,DIALOGUESCENE537_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,How did it collapse?
1045119799372,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE11,That is one of the great mysteries scholars were never able to find out.
1045119799373,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,"Despite exhaustive researches, no conclusive evidence has ever been uncovered to shed light on the root cause of the empire's enigmatic disappearance."
1045119799374,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE13,"No signs of plagues, no signs of invading forces and no signs of a natural disaster."
1045119799375,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE14,For all we know everything was fine until they were not.
1045119799376,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE15,"However, given the limited progress in our technology and scientific understanding since the time of the empire, coupled with the vast expanse of unexplored territories, it is evident that a momentous event must have transpired."
1045119799377,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE16,"Something that resulted in a significant loss of life, leaving only a small group of survivors to undertake the arduous task of reconstruction."
1045119799378,DIALOGUESCENE537_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,That kinda sounds...terrifying.
1045119799379,DIALOGUESCENE537_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE18,No. It sounds like a captivating enigma eagerly awaiting our discovery and unraveling.
1045119799380,DIALOGUESCENE538_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,I shall return to my studies then.
1045119799381,DIALOGUESCENE539_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,You require my attention?
1045119799382,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,"As you may already have surmised, my son has followed me in my scholarly footstep and delves into the very same subject as I."
1045119799383,DIALOGUESCENE540_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"He really seems to look up to you, seeing as how he talked about you."
1045119799384,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,"...Originally, I thought that his intentions for doing so, were more...unpleasant."
1045119799385,DIALOGUESCENE540_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Huh?
1045119799386,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,"Guild Master, based on your knowledge of me thus far, do you perceive that I possess the qualities requisite for a commendable mother?"
1045119799387,DIALOGUESCENE540_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Well, I don't really have a good role model to compare to."
1045119799388,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,"...In my younger years I have dedicated a substantial portion of my existence to the pursuit of knowledge. As an avid seeker of wisdom, I embraced the mantle of a scholar."
1045119799389,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,"During that time, my thoughts were guided predominantly by intellectual pursuits, and my heart was steadfastly loyal to the realm of academia."
1045119799390,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,"Indeed, the notion of starting a family has always eluded me. "
1045119799391,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE10,"Nonetheless, as you can see my life has diverged from the path I once envisioned."
1045119799392,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE11,"As much as I loved my boy, I never could give up on my studies and I must confess that as a result I neglected my motherly duties throughout the majority of his life."
1045119799393,DIALOGUESCENE540_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,So you thought...?
1045119799394,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE13,I assumed he attempted to surpass my own accomplishments in the field most important to me. To show me how little I really accomplished at the expense of our relationship.
1045119799395,DIALOGUESCENE540_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,"Well, in the end it was different than that, wasn't it."
1045119799396,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE15,"Indeed. Nevertheless, I feel that I need to try harder to become a mother that my boy deserves."
1045119799397,DIALOGUESCENE540_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,Don't forget being a grandmother now too.
1045119799398,DIALOGUESCENE540_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE17,Do not even start on this one. I am still having a hard time processing this revelation.
1045119799399,DIALOGUESCENE541_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,Is there more you need to discuss?
1045119799400,DIALOGUESCENE542_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Our adventurers fought against a bandit who had a strange tattoo on his face. From what they told it seemed like the mark gave him some strange powers.
1045119799401,DIALOGUESCENE542_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Because it seemed related to magic I was wondering if you maybe knew what they were.
1045119799402,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,Can you describe the appearance of that tattoo?
1045119799403,DIALOGUESCENE542_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,The adventurers made a sketch of it. Here look.
1045119799404,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045119799405,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,Fascinating!
1045119799406,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>This mark! It's the mark of a demon lord.
1045119799407,DIALOGUESCENE542_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,I don't like the sound of that...
1045119799408,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,How very interesting. There have always been people trying to make foolhardy pacts with demons but this is the first time I see a mark from an actual demon lord.
1045119799409,DIALOGUESCENE542_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"So, what does it actually do?"
1045119799410,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE11,It acts like a blessing. The wearer is granted a small part of the demon lord's power and that can manifest itself in a plethora of different ways.
1045119799411,DIALOGUESCENE542_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,*sigh*<waitfor=0.5>As if bandits didn't already cause enough headache. Now you're saying that the bandits are making deals with literal devils.
1045119799412,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE13,"It isn't as simple as that, Guild Master."
1045119799413,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE14,"Demon lords are far different from the ordinary demons you might know of.
They could be considered on the same level as the gods."
1045119799414,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE15,The rituals required to make contact with them are only known as fairy tales to a few. They weren't considered real.
1045119799415,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE16,Until today at least.
1045119799416,DIALOGUESCENE542_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,Then how do these bandits know them?
1045119799417,DIALOGUESCENE542_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE18,That's the question indeed. Unfortunately I do not know the answer to it.
1045119799418,DIALOGUESCENE542_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,(Bandits and demons. Ugh...I got a bad feeling about this.)
1045119799419,DIALOGUESCENE543_BAI_DIALOGUE1,Bandit attacks were the best when I was travelling.
1045119799420,DIALOGUESCENE543_BAI_DIALOGUE2,Sure the fights were mostly lackluster and most of the time they already went down after a hit.
1045119799421,DIALOGUESCENE543_BAI_DIALOGUE3,But they usually had stuff with them I could use or sell. Even better when they had booze with them.
1045119799422,DIALOGUESCENE543_BAI_DIALOGUE4,"Sometimes I would travel up and down a road, hoping to get ambushed."
1045119799423,DIALOGUESCENE543_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...
1045119799424,DIALOGUESCENE543_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I'd like to say I'm surprised but I'd be lying.
1045119799425,DIALOGUESCENE544_BAI_DIALOGUE1,That Bandit King sounds like my type of a guy.
1045119799426,DIALOGUESCENE544_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Really?
1045119799427,DIALOGUESCENE544_BAI_DIALOGUE3,"Yeah, the kinda guy I could beat up and don't even have to feel bad about it."
1045119799428,DIALOGUESCENE544_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,You feel bad about the people you beat up?
1045119799429,DIALOGUESCENE544_BAI_DIALOGUE5,Of course. I pity them for being so weak!
1045119799430,DIALOGUESCENE545_BAI_DIALOGUE1,The Divine Messenger? Who's that?
1045119799431,DIALOGUESCENE545_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,You've never heard of her? The one chosen by the divines as their speaker?
1045119799432,DIALOGUESCENE545_BAI_DIALOGUE3,The Divines?
1045119799433,DIALOGUESCENE545_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,The seven gods? Those who most people worship here?
1045119799434,DIALOGUESCENE545_BAI_DIALOGUE5,Never heard of them.
1045119799435,DIALOGUESCENE545_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...Maybe your village has other gods. What do you worship in your village?
1045119799436,DIALOGUESCENE545_BAI_DIALOGUE7,I dunno. I think a dragon or something like that?
1045119799437,DIALOGUESCENE545_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,<?shakeScreen>How do you not know?
1045119799438,DIALOGUESCENE545_BAI_DIALOGUE9,Cause it's boring! Booh!
1045119799439,DIALOGUESCENE545_BAI_DIALOGUE10,I'll start worshipping a god if they can win against me in a fistfight.
1045119799440,DIALOGUESCENE545_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,(...Great. Now I have the image of Bai fist fighting a dragon in my head.)
1045119799441,DIALOGUESCENE546_BAI_DIALOGUE1,She seems tough. She kinda reminds me of some of the old people in my village.
1045119799442,DIALOGUESCENE546_BAI_DIALOGUE2,The ones who look like they have tons of experiences in real battle. For some reason it even feels like she has even more experience than them.
1045119799443,DIALOGUESCENE546_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,It's strange you'd think that.
1045119799444,DIALOGUESCENE546_BAI_DIALOGUE4,Just saying how I see it. She just feels older than anyone I've ever met. Stronger too.
1045123993600,DIALOGUESCENE546_BAI_DIALOGUE5,It makes me want to exchange some blows with her if I ever get the chance.
1045123993601,DIALOGUESCENE546_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"...So, age doesn't matter to you when it comes to beating people..."
1045123993602,DIALOGUESCENE547_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,When we first met you told us that you left your village to find students for your Martial Arts Style.
1045123993603,DIALOGUESCENE547_BAI_DIALOGUE2,"You mean ""My Fist in your Face""-Style."
1045123993604,DIALOGUESCENE547_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...Yeah.
1045123993605,DIALOGUESCENE547_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I was wondering if everybody there wears clothes like yours?
1045123993606,DIALOGUESCENE547_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,It seems kinda...foreign to me.
1045123993607,DIALOGUESCENE547_BAI_DIALOGUE6,"Well..., I think my old folks said something about our ancestors coming from far away and founding that village..."
1045123993608,DIALOGUESCENE547_BAI_DIALOGUE7,...but I didn't really listen.
1045123993609,DIALOGUESCENE547_BAI_DIALOGUE8,"Who cares, anyway? Not like the people inside my village and those outside differ so much."
1045123993610,DIALOGUESCENE547_BAI_DIALOGUE9,They all suck at taking a punch.
1045123993611,DIALOGUESCENE547_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"So, you're also like this at home..."
1045123993612,DIALOGUESCENE547_BAI_DIALOGUE11,My old man always said that people talk with their fists.
1045123993613,DIALOGUESCENE547_BAI_DIALOGUE12,But lately when I communicate with my father he's always quick to shedding tears.
1045123993614,DIALOGUESCENE547_BAI_DIALOGUE13,I guess old age made him emotional. Bwahahaha!
1045123993615,DIALOGUESCENE547_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,(Sounds more like his lessons have backfired on him.)
1045123993616,DIALOGUESCENE548_BAI_DIALOGUE1,Good! I needed a drink anyway.
1045123993617,DIALOGUESCENE549_BAI_DIALOGUE1,"Yo, what's up?"
1045123993618,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,You mentioned your father before. Is there anyone else in your family?
1045123993619,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE2,"Of course there are. My mother for example, duh!"
1045123993620,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...is she like you?
1045123993621,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE4,"Nah. Unlike me, she occasionally gets beaten up by the old man."
1045123993622,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>(Domestic Violence?)
1045123993623,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE6,But sometimes she does get a few good hits back.
1045123993624,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,<?whiteFlash>Huh?
1045123993625,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE8,I guess her track record against my old man is about 40 to 60 perhaps?
1045123993626,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Are you saying that your parents usually fight each other?
1045123993627,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE10,Course they do! How else would they determine the head of the family?
1045123993628,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"(So I guess the whole family is like that, huh?)"
1045123993629,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE12,"Of course, by the time I was 16, I was able to beat both their asses and became top dog of the house."
1045123993630,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE13,After that they never got their position back! Not even when they tried to ambush me together! Bwahahaha!
1045123993631,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE14,I also had an older brother who tried to put his hat into the ring for the position of the house head.
1045123993632,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE15,"But when his five-year old sister was able to beat him up, he disappointedly gave up and started farming instead."
1045123993633,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,"(He was probably like ""Screw this shit! I'm out of here!"")"
1045123993634,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE17,He actually married the neighbor's girl. The two of them have been multiplying like rabbits. They probably have their 12th kid right now.
1045123993635,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,<?shakeScreen>(Is the girl alright?)
1045123993636,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE19,I actually wanted to take all my nieces and nephews as students but for some reason my older brother was so much against it.
1045123993637,DIALOGUESCENE550_BAI_DIALOGUE20,"Well, whatever! Maybe next time when I'm back."
1045123993638,DIALOGUESCENE550_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE21,(I think the world isn't ready for Bai and a horde of miniature versions of her running around wrecking places.)
1045123993639,DIALOGUESCENE551_BAI_DIALOGUE1,Are we done? I'm getting hungry.
1045123993640,DIALOGUESCENE552_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So you and Shen are childhood friends?
1045123993641,DIALOGUESCENE552_BAI_DIALOGUE2,No. Me and Yu were childhood friends.
1045123993642,DIALOGUESCENE552_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Aren't they the same person?
1045123993643,DIALOGUESCENE552_BAI_DIALOGUE4,No.
1045123993644,DIALOGUESCENE552_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"(That 'no' sounded like if I say otherwise, she's going to punch me.)"
1045123993645,DIALOGUESCENE552_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"You really don't like Shen, do you?"
1045123993646,DIALOGUESCENE552_BAI_DIALOGUE7,...
1045123993647,DIALOGUESCENE553_BAI_DIALOGUE1,Do you know how long it has been since I last saw Yu?
1045123993648,DIALOGUESCENE553_BAI_DIALOGUE2,In the beginning he just wore the mask a few times during his training. But slowly he has started to wear it more and more often.
1045123993649,DIALOGUESCENE553_BAI_DIALOGUE3,Until most of the time I would only see him while wearing that stupid mask.
1045123993650,DIALOGUESCENE553_BAI_DIALOGUE4,No one in the village seemed to mind it. They say it gives Yu confidence and he becomes a better fighter with it.
1045123993651,DIALOGUESCENE553_BAI_DIALOGUE5,"...But that's not Yu.
It's Shen."
1045123993652,DIALOGUESCENE553_BAI_DIALOGUE6,I'd smash the mask to bits but it would only upset Yu.
1045123993653,DIALOGUESCENE553_BAI_DIALOGUE7,"So, yeah. I do not like Shen."
1045123993654,DIALOGUESCENE554_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So what can you tell me about Yu?
1045123993655,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE2,Yu? He's a big wuss. Probably the biggest I know of.
1045123993656,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE3,There are often these kid tournaments between all the martial art schools in my village and Yu was usually one of the first to lose.
1045123993657,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE4,My first impression of him was really horrible. I thought he was just some uninteresting weakling with a girly face.
1045123993658,DIALOGUESCENE554_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Then how did you end up being friends?
1045123993659,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE6,"Well, one time I saw him training on his own on his blade skills and there I saw him do a really awesome move. It was so fast and precise that I doubted that I could dodge it. That's when I started to get interested in him."
1045123993660,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE7,I wondered what it would be like if he used that technique on me. In my excitement I immediately approached him and attacked him!
1045123993661,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE8,"However, he went down crying easily without even using that move."
1045123993662,DIALOGUESCENE554_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,(It sounds like you just bullied a poor kid.)
1045123993663,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE10, I asked him why he didn't use the move from earlier and he told me he couldn't do it in front of other people.
1045123993664,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE11,I was kinda frustrated that I wouldn't be able to fight him at his best so I offered to help him train until he could fight me properly.
1045123993665,DIALOGUESCENE554_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,How did he answer?
1045123993666,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE13,He ran away.
1045123993667,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE14,"However, mama didn't raise a quitter so I chased after him every day, demanding him to train with me."
1045123993668,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE15,"I ambushed him when he was alone, sometimes beat up his bullies and even watched him pee that one time."
1045123993669,DIALOGUESCENE554_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,(...wait. What was that last part?)
1045123993670,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE17,"Eventually, he finally caved in and we started training together. "
1045123993671,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE18,We fought often and every time I would just beat him up. But I realized that there was a talent hidden behind all those awkward moves.
1045123993672,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE19,"Then, after a month or so he finally managed to use that one technique on me and I hit the floor."
1045123993673,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE20,He looked so happy when he did it. I was also really proud of him. I was so proud in fact that I stopped pulling my punches in the second round that day. Bwahahaha!
1045123993674,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE21,...
1045123993675,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE22,Yu is a wuss but he's also kinda lovable. He always tried his best to live up to the expectations put on him and worked hard on himself.
1045123993676,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE23,...He would have eventually become the master of the Azure Blade Style if they've just given him more time.
1045123993677,DIALOGUESCENE554_BAI_DIALOGUE24,Instead they put that stupid mask on him.
1045123993678,DIALOGUESCENE555_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>BANDITS?
1045123993679,DIALOGUESCENE555_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>WHERE ARE THEY? I'LL DELIVER JUSTICE ON THEM MYSELF!
1045123993680,DIALOGUESCENE555_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"No, Zoldak! There are no bandits here!"
1045123993681,DIALOGUESCENE555_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,I was just wondering what you think about them abducting people.
1045123993682,DIALOGUESCENE555_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>THEY DO WHAT?!!!
1045123993683,DIALOGUESCENE555_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>I SHALL VENTURE FORTH AND FREE THEM!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045123993684,DIALOGUESCENE555_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Damn it! Wait Zoldak! WAIT!
1045123993685,DIALOGUESCENE556_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen><?whiteFlash>A Bandit King!????
1045123993686,DIALOGUESCENE556_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>Now this certainly can't stand! When do we deliver justice to him?
1045123993687,DIALOGUESCENE556_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Eh...we don't. A subjugation force is already being formed to deal with him.
1045123993688,DIALOGUESCENE556_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE4,<?shakeScreen> Then I shall go and volunteer for that force of good!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045123993689,DIALOGUESCENE556_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"<?shakeScreen> W-Wait Zoldak!
(Ah! Whatever! I  doubt they'll let a man his age join.)"
1045123993690,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>The Divine Messenger is coming here?!
1045123993691,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>We need to make sure that everything is safe before she arrives!
1045123993692,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>We have to put guards wherever we can! Investigate anyone who comes in and out of the Adventurer Guild!
1045123993693,DIALOGUESCENE557_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...I should have known you'd overreact.
1045123993694,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>Overreact?
1045123993695,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE6,Do you know how dangerous the position of the Divine Messenger is?
1045123993696,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE7,There are many dark forces that want her dead.
1045123993697,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE8,There have been many Divine Messengers before the current one.
1045123993698,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE9,And none of them died peacefully.
1045123993699,DIALOGUESCENE557_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE10,"That's why, I will take any precaution necessary to protect the current Divine Messenger, Guild Master."
1045123993700,DIALOGUESCENE558_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,"Well done, Guild Master!"
1045123993701,DIALOGUESCENE558_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE2,"With this deed, you have saved countless people from a gruesome fate and the witch will finally have to answer for all her crimes."
1045123993702,DIALOGUESCENE558_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Well, currently it doesn't seem like she wants to answer anything at all. And I still have so many questions."
1045123993703,DIALOGUESCENE558_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>Aren't paladins supposed to be really charismatic and pretty good in convincing people? Do you maybe have any tips what I can do to get an answer out of her?
1045123993704,DIALOGUESCENE558_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Of course! Just keep asking her until she answers! It's just a matter of endurance! Most people will crumble if you repeat the same question for a week!
1045123993705,DIALOGUESCENE558_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,...Forget I asked.
1045123993706,DIALOGUESCENE559_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,Good. I'll continue my patrol then!
1045123993707,DIALOGUESCENE560_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,Guild Master! I'm happy to report that I have not seen any evil today!
1045123993708,DIALOGUESCENE561_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,...I heard the adventurers have defeated the Lich.
1045123993709,DIALOGUESCENE561_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,They did. I hope you're not angry that they did it without you.
1045123993710,DIALOGUESCENE561_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE3,"...No.
I'm just angry at myself for being such a fool."
1045123993711,DIALOGUESCENE561_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE4,"The boy was right. I would have just killed myself.
My own sins have made me blind to what truly matters."
1045123993712,DIALOGUESCENE561_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Your sins?
1045123993713,DIALOGUESCENE561_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE6,"...I presume Eden has told you that I was once sent with some of my fellow comrades to vanquish the Lich, hasn't he?"
1045123993714,DIALOGUESCENE561_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Yeah. He told me that you were the only survivor.
1045123993715,DIALOGUESCENE561_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE8,...There is a reason for that.
1045123993716,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,"When we encountered the Lich, I...I fled."
1045123993717,DIALOGUESCENE562_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"<?whiteFlash>!!!
That's...hard to believe."
1045123993718,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE3,"And yet it's the truth.
When I stood in front of that Lich so many years ago, I felt a primal fear I have never felt before."
1045123993719,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE4,"Before I knew it, I was already running away, abandoning my brothers and sisters.
Their deaths are on my hands."
1045123993720,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE5,"I was forgiven for my cowardice.
People around me said that it would have made no difference."
1045123993721,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE6,"But yet not one day goes by where I wonder, if we would have prevailed if I had stayed.
My fellow paladins were great people. How many lives weren't saved because I let them die?"
1045123993722,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE7,"How many lives were lost because the Lich continued to exist because of me?
How many people have I doomed because I've let evil prevail?
"
1045123993723,DIALOGUESCENE562_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Is that why you never stopped being a Paladin?
1045123993724,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE9,"I had hoped that I could find redemption, but at my age, I realized it's not that simple."
1045123993725,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE10,"Can a good deed truly make up for an evil deed?
Can I really be forgiven without the forgiveness of those I have wronged?
What good is it for those I've failed to protect if I saved others?"
1045123993726,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE11,I have struggled with those questions my whole life.
1045123993727,DIALOGUESCENE562_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE12,"So I decided that all I can do is to do as much good as I can, until these old bones turn to dust."
1045123993728,DIALOGUESCENE563_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"...Zoldak, I have known you long enough that I have a good picture of you.
"
1045123993729,DIALOGUESCENE563_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"You're a stubborn old man, who far too often acts before he thinks."
1045123993730,DIALOGUESCENE563_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE3,That's...true but still hurtful.
1045123993731,DIALOGUESCENE564_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>But you're also a man who actually cares.
I've seen enough people who'd rather turn a blind eye to what they've done."
1045123993732,DIALOGUESCENE564_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"In my eyes, you're already a good man, and if you think otherwise, then you've gone senile, old man."
1045123993733,DIALOGUESCENE564_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE3,"...Thank you, Guild Master. I appreciate what you said."
1045123993734,DIALOGUESCENE564_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Now, how about we train some Paladins? Maybe we can have that army of Paladins after all."
1045123993735,DIALOGUESCENE564_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Does that mean you've finally approved of my new Training Plan?
1045123993736,DIALOGUESCENE564_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"You mean the one with the sharks and acid?
...No. Definitely no."
1045123993737,DIALOGUESCENE565_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE1,How else can I help?
1045123993738,DIALOGUESCENE566_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I heard from Eden you had a hard time settling down.
1045123993739,DIALOGUESCENE566_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE2,Hmph! That boy worries too much. I'm still perfectly fine!
1045123993740,DIALOGUESCENE566_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE3,"Evil does not know rest, so neither do I!"
1045123993741,DIALOGUESCENE566_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Pretty sure evil has to rest too.
1045123993742,DIALOGUESCENE566_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>Then that's even more reason not to rest!
1045123993743,DIALOGUESCENE566_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>We will not only catch up to evil! We shall overtake it!
1045123993744,DIALOGUESCENE566_ZOLDAK_DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen> Then we'll trip evil, push it to the ground and beat it to an inch of its life!"
1045123993745,DIALOGUESCENE566_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"...You do hear yourself, right?"
1045123993746,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Can you really not tell me who ""they"" are?"
1045123993747,DIALOGUESCENE567_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>What? No! Of course not!
1045123993748,DIALOGUESCENE567_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,Haven't you been listening to me before?
1045123993749,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,You don't even have to tell me the name of that group. Just tell me what exactly they're doing.
1045123993750,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Are they controlling the world from the shadows? Do they manipulate the weather? Is Three-Silver in reality not dead?
1045123993751,DIALOGUESCENE567_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>Stop it! This is no joke! Why do you even want to know?
1045123993752,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,I feel like I can't take them seriously otherwise...
1045123993753,DIALOGUESCENE567_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,What?
1045123993754,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,All I know about them is that they're shadowy and powerful.
1045123993755,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,I'd like to add evil but I feel like that would completely erase any amount of seriousness I had for them.
1045123993756,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,They're so vague that I don't even believe that they will become relevant to us in any form.
1045123993757,DIALOGUESCENE567_ROGUE_DIALOGUE12,That's a good thing! We want that!
1045123993758,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,..Maybe you're right.
1045123993759,DIALOGUESCENE567_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Just stop mentioning them. Otherwise I feel like a lot of people will get disappointed.
1045123993760,DIALOGUESCENE567_ROGUE_DIALOGUE15,...
1045123993761,DIALOGUESCENE568_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"I admit that when I first heard that the bandits are acting up, I was suspicious whether ""they"" had anything to do with it."
1045123993762,DIALOGUESCENE568_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,You think they do?
1045128187904,DIALOGUESCENE568_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,Not anymore.
1045128187905,DIALOGUESCENE568_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,"I investigated it but ""they"" would be far more subtle in their approach."
1045128187906,DIALOGUESCENE568_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Well, it would have been weird in the first place if ""they"" just randomly had anything do with bandits."
1045128187907,DIALOGUESCENE568_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,"Don't underestimate their reach, Guild Master."
1045128187908,DIALOGUESCENE568_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,"There are lots of things that seem unrelated but are actually influenced by ""them""."
1045128187909,DIALOGUESCENE568_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"...One day you really have to tell me who ""they"" are."
1045128187910,DIALOGUESCENE568_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>Never!
1045128187911,DIALOGUESCENE568_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"<?shakeScreen>Then stop building ""them"" up!"
1045128187912,DIALOGUESCENE569_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,That's quite the fancy title for a dead man.
1045128187913,DIALOGUESCENE569_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What do you mean?
1045128187914,DIALOGUESCENE569_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,"In my experience someone who calls this much attention to themself, won't live for long."
1045128187915,DIALOGUESCENE570_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"I do not trust her, Guild Master."
1045128187916,DIALOGUESCENE570_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,"When she gave the former Guild Master their first Quest, we suspiciously lacked a lot of information about the enemy."
1045128187917,DIALOGUESCENE570_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,"We were only told that they were some sort of cultists, demon worshippers or other kind of fanatics."
1045128187918,DIALOGUESCENE570_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,But it's apparent now that they're too organized to be simply that.
1045128187919,DIALOGUESCENE570_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,And I'm sure the Divine Messenger knew that.
1045128187920,DIALOGUESCENE570_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,They're hiding something. I can feel it.
1045128187921,DIALOGUESCENE570_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,My advice for you Guild Master: Take everything she says with a grain of salt.
1045128187922,DIALOGUESCENE571_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"I'm sorry, Guild Master."
1045128187923,DIALOGUESCENE571_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,What for?
1045128187924,DIALOGUESCENE571_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,I feel like I could have prevented the attack.
1045128187925,DIALOGUESCENE571_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,I already noticed that there were some suspicious behaviour amongst the adventurers.
1045128187926,DIALOGUESCENE571_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,"But I was only preoccupied with my own situation and left it alone when I was sure it had nothing to do with ""them""."
1045128187927,DIALOGUESCENE571_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,I blame myself for what happened.
1045128187928,DIALOGUESCENE571_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,"If only I also thought about the safety of the Adventurer Guild, then maybe the former Guild Master wouldn't have died."
1045128187929,DIALOGUESCENE571_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"...You didn't know, Rogue. You couldn't have known what would happen."
1045128187930,DIALOGUESCENE571_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...I do not blame you. 
1045128187931,DIALOGUESCENE571_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,"...Thank you, Guild Master. That...means a lot to me."
1045128187932,DIALOGUESCENE572_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"This whole matter with the gods stinks, Guild Master!"
1045128187933,DIALOGUESCENE572_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,It's obvious now that they're hiding something from us and the witch is the key to it.
1045128187934,DIALOGUESCENE572_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"I agree with you.
Something is definitely off."
1045128187935,DIALOGUESCENE572_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Any tips on how to get some answers out of the witch?
1045128187936,DIALOGUESCENE572_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,I'd advise against any form of violence. It just gives you unreliable information.
1045128187937,DIALOGUESCENE572_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,The most effective approach is to make them want to talk to you. Try to gain their trust or provoke them.
1045128187938,DIALOGUESCENE572_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Thanks for the tips, Rogue."
1045128187939,DIALOGUESCENE573_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"Watch your back, Guild Master."
1045128187940,DIALOGUESCENE574_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,"It's safe to talk here, Guild Master."
1045128187941,DIALOGUESCENE575_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,So about Luana...
1045128187942,DIALOGUESCENE575_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,W-What about her?
1045128187943,DIALOGUESCENE575_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,She mentioned you.
1045128187944,DIALOGUESCENE575_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,W-what did she say?
1045128187945,DIALOGUESCENE575_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,...I forgot.
1045128187946,DIALOGUESCENE575_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,Guild Master!
1045128187947,DIALOGUESCENE575_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,"You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?"
1045128187948,DIALOGUESCENE575_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Maybe.
1045128187949,DIALOGUESCENE576_ROGUE_DIALOGUE1,We should keep it short.
1045128187950,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Seeing you like this, I wonder if it's a trend in this Guild for people to hide their identities."
1045128187951,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,"I assure you that there is a perfectly valid reason for this, Guild Master."
1045128187952,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE3,You just might not like it...
1045128187953,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"*sigh*. Alright, I'm listening."
1045128187954,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,...I'm in hiding. 
1045128187955,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,There is a group of people...who are after me and they would stop at nothing to get to me.
1045128187956,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,"To reduce the risk of getting found I can not let anyone see me nor know my name, lest it might reach ""them""."
1045128187957,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...What did you do that you have to go hiding?
1045128187958,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE9,It isn't about what I did. It's about what I know.
1045128187959,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,"I'm a loose end and ""they"" usually don't let loose ends live for long."
1045128187960,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"Who are ""they""?"
1045128187961,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE12,"I can't tell you, Guild Master. It's better if you don't know."
1045128187962,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE13,"""They"" do not like to be known and will silence everyone who do."
1045128187963,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,"So, you're saying that a shadowy group of powerful people wants you dead."
1045128187964,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"So powerful in fact,  that the mere mention of your name and your appearance could reach their ears."
1045128187965,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,And anyone who might have an inkling of knowledge about them gets killed.
1045128187966,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE17,"Y-yeah, that kinda sums it up."
1045128187967,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,...Either I've suddenly landed in some talentless bard's tale of conspiracy theories or Fran has gotten himself in quite the mess by taking you in.
1045128187968,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,How did he even become a part of this?
1045128187969,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE20,It's my fault...
1045128187970,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE21,He inadvertently got dragged in a situation where I got found out by my pursuers. 
1045128187971,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE22,He...actually saved me.
1045128187972,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE23,"When I gave him a roundabout explanation of my situation, he insisted that I could hide at the Guild."
1045128187973,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE24,"Now that he's gone, I'm well aware that you have no obligation to let me stay here."
1045128187974,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE25,If you want me to go then I'll go.
1045128187975,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE26,...
1045128187976,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,You can stay.
1045128187977,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE28,Are you sure about that? The people who are after me are to be feared.
1045128187978,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE29,How am I supposed to fear something that is completely vague?
1045128187979,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE30,And besides...I won't just revert a decision made by Fran.
1045128187980,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE31,"If he allowed you to hide here, then you can hide here."
1045128187981,DIALOGUESCENE577_ROGUE_DIALOGUE32,"I see you're just like him. Thank you, Guild Master."
1045128187982,DIALOGUESCENE577_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE33,...
1045128187983,DIALOGUESCENE578_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Now that you don't have to fear ""them"" anymore, you don't really have any reasons to hide your face anymore, right?"
1045128187984,DIALOGUESCENE578_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,...Maybe...
1045128187985,DIALOGUESCENE578_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...You're still going to hide it, aren't you?"
1045128187986,DIALOGUESCENE578_ROGUE_DIALOGUE4,"<?shakeScreen>I-it's nothing personal, Guild Master!"
1045128187987,DIALOGUESCENE578_ROGUE_DIALOGUE5,I-it's just that after knowing me for so long with my hood on...I'm kinda scared that you'll think differently of me when I reveal my face.
1045128187988,DIALOGUESCENE578_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,I don't care if you're ugly or anything like that.
1045128187989,DIALOGUESCENE578_ROGUE_DIALOGUE7,<?shakeScreen>I-I'm not ugly!
1045128187990,DIALOGUESCENE578_ROGUE_DIALOGUE8,A-at least that's what Luana said.
1045128187991,DIALOGUESCENE578_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,(I have no idea how to process that statement.)
1045128187992,DIALOGUESCENE578_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,"I-I just need a bit more time, Guild Master."
1045128187993,DIALOGUESCENE578_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,Fine...I'll wait.
1045128187994,DIALOGUESCENE578_ROGUE_DIALOGUE12,"Thanks, Guild Master."
1045128187995,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045128187996,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE2,Hello Guild Master.
1045128187997,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"<?whiteFlash>Hello?
...Is someone there?"
1045128187998,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?grayFlash><?shakeScreen>WHOA!
1045128187999,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Did you just appear out of nowhere?
Who are you?"
1045128188000,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE6,"I'm Rogue, an instructor in the Adventurer Guild. I thought it was time we met."
1045128188001,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Ah, I see."
1045128188002,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...
1045128188003,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,...Why didn't you look for me in the beginning?
1045128188004,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE10,That's because I've been observing you for the last few days.
1045128188005,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,<?whiteFlash>W-what?
1045128188006,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE12,I've also checked your background.
1045128188007,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE13,Your name is {PROTAGONIST}. Gender unknown. You've started adventuring at the age of 13 with the previous Guild Master but have known each other for much longer.
1045128188008,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE14,You adventured together for more than ten years until you two went your seperate ways. 
1045128188009,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE15,You continued to make your living as adventurer for a couple more years but never joined hands with other adventurers ever again.
1045128188010,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE16,Three years ago you retired after a stray arrow hit you in the knee. Since then you've been living on the money you saved up but it was barely enough to keep you afloat.
1045128188011,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE17,"Then about two weeks ago, the letter of the previous Guild Master arrived and you came here as the new Guild Master."
1045128188012,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,...That was pretty accurate...
1045128188013,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,Now for the important question:
1045128188014,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,Why?
1045128188015,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE21,"I'm sorry Guild Master, but I had to make sure that you were in no way affiliated with ""them""!"
1045128188016,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE22,"""Them?"" Who are ""them"" ?"
1045128188017,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE23,"I'm sorry but I can't tell you that! The mere knowledge of ""them"" is dangerous!"
1045128188018,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,Then how am I supposed to know if I am affiliated with them? Does any of that have to do with why you're hiding your face? Is Rogue even your real name?
1045128188019,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE25,All valid questions but I think it's better if we don't talk here.
1045128188020,DIALOGUESCENE579_ROGUE_DIALOGUE26,Come and meet me if you want to talk.
1045128188021,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,<?grayFlash><?shakeScreen>(...)
1045128188022,DIALOGUESCENE579_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE28,"(...Where did you even find these people, Fran?)"
1045128188023,DIALOGUESCENE580_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,The last place I want you to visit is maybe the most important one in the entire Adventurer Guild.
1045128188024,DIALOGUESCENE580_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,And I'm not saying that just because it's my workplace!
1045128188025,DIALOGUESCENE580_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,Hahahahaha!
1045128188026,DIALOGUESCENE580_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,....
1045128188027,DIALOGUESCENE580_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,....
1045128188028,DIALOGUESCENE580_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,....Geez. Would it hurt you to try to be more sociable?
1045128188029,DIALOGUESCENE581_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,This here is my domain. This is the training ground where we veterans teach the Adventurers all of our skills and knowledge.
1045128188030,DIALOGUESCENE581_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Are you the only teacher here?
1045128188031,DIALOGUESCENE581_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,"No, of course not. Adventurer Parties need to have many different roles. I might be good with a sword but I'm lousy with other weapons."
1045128188032,DIALOGUESCENE581_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,For that we have other instructors. We used to have dozens of instructors with different skillsets to teach. But unfortunately most have left the Guild since its decline.
1045128188033,DIALOGUESCENE581_FALKEN_DIALOGUE5,I hope that we might gather new instructors again after our reputation improves.
1045128188034,DIALOGUESCENE581_FALKEN_DIALOGUE6,But those who stayed with us are exceptionally talented people. Currently they don't seem to be here but you should talk to them when you see them. They're good people!
1045128188035,DIALOGUESCENE581_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,I do not doubt it. Fran always had an eye for good people.
1045128188036,DIALOGUESCENE581_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,"Well, there is one exception."
1045128188037,DIALOGUESCENE581_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,Talking about yourself?
1045128188038,DIALOGUESCENE581_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,...
1045128188039,DIALOGUESCENE581_FALKEN_DIALOGUE11,Seriously guys. Didn't you say you haven't seen each other for 10 years? How could anyone still hold so much hostility after that long of a time?
1045128188040,DIALOGUESCENE581_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,It's
1045128188041,DIALOGUESCENE581_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,easy
1045128188042,DIALOGUESCENE581_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,if
1045128188043,DIALOGUESCENE581_FIOLA_DIALOGUE15,it's
1045128188044,DIALOGUESCENE581_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,her!
1045128188045,DIALOGUESCENE581_FALKEN_DIALOGUE17,At least I'll know who's responsible if either of you end up dead.
1045128188046,DIALOGUESCENE582_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Good work, everyone!"
1045128188047,DIALOGUESCENE582_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,At this point you're all probably exhausted.
1045128188048,DIALOGUESCENE582_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,We should camp now to get you some rest. It's important to always know when to take a break and recover.
1045128188049,DIALOGUESCENE583_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE1,It shouldn't be much further from here.
1045128188050,DIALOGUESCENE583_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE2,"If we follow the road, we should be arriving at the Guild in no time."
1045128188051,DIALOGUESCENE583_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Good to hear. This journey has been...exhausting. 
1045128188052,DIALOGUESCENE584_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,You got us lost several times and we had to pretty much run from every encounter we came across.
1045128188053,DIALOGUESCENE584_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Honestly, I'm surprised that we even survived this far."
1045128188054,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,"...Yes, sorry about that Guild Master. We haven't been adventurers for long..."
1045128188055,DIALOGUESCENE584_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,(Guild Master...It's still weird hearing that.)
1045128188056,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,"I guess we didn't really show our best side so far, did we?"
1045128188057,DIALOGUESCENE584_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"No.
No, you didn't."
1045128188058,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE7,"(Geez! We really didn't start off on the right foot with our future boss, did we?)"
1045128188059,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE8,(Time to butter up!)
1045128188060,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE9,I know we haven't been that great so far! But we're still young and learning!
1045128188061,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE10,I'm sure we'll improve in no time under your leadership!
1045128188062,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE11," Especially, when you're such a handsome m.<waitfor=0.3>.<waitfor=0.3>."
1045128188063,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE12,<?whiteFlash>...eh...I mean pretty w.<waitfor=0.3>.<waitfor=0.3>.
1045128188064,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE13,<speed=7><?shakeScreen>...good looking person!
1045128188065,DIALOGUESCENE584_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Thank you...I guess?
1045128188066,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE15,<?shakeScreen>(What was that stutter just now?)
1045128188067,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE16,(I just noticed I can't tell if our Guild Master is a man or woman.)
1045128188068,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE17,(What are you talking about? Of course it's a...)
1045128188069,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE18,<?whiteFlash>(a...<waitfor=0.5>ah....)
1045132382208,DIALOGUESCENE584_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE19,"<speed=2><?shakeScreen>(See?! You can't tell either, right?)"
1045132382209,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE20,(I have an idea.)
1045132382210,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE21,Guild Master! I noticed we never called you by your name.
1045132382211,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE22,I kinda feel bad about it. It makes everything so formal.

1045132382213,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE24,<speed=2><?shakeScreen>Y-yes! Of course!
1045132382214,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE25,"But it just doesn't seem right, if we don't at least know your name."
1045132382215,DIALOGUESCENE584_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE26,"So, could you tell us?"
1045132382216,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"I guess there's no harm in that.
It's {PROTAGONIST}."
1045132382217,DIALOGUESCENE585_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE2,"{PROTAGONIST}. Ah, I see!"
1045132382218,DIALOGUESCENE585_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE3,Of course! Of course!
1045132382219,DIALOGUESCENE585_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE4,"(...You still can't tell, can you?)"
1045132382220,DIALOGUESCENE585_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE5,(No...)
1045132382221,DIALOGUESCENE585_FEMALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE6,(...You think it'd be awkward to ask now?)
1045132382222,DIALOGUESCENE585_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE7,<speed=2>(What d'ya think? <speed=1>For now let's just keep rolling with it and avoid the use of pronouns.)
1045132382223,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"If you're done whispering, I have a suggestion to make."
1045132382224,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"As you said, you're still capable of learning. But I do want to reach the Guild in one piece, so here is my suggestion:"
1045132382225,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"For the remainder of the journey, let me take charge. I used to be an adventurer for more than half my lifetime and I'm sure that I can bring the best out of you."
1045132382226,DIALOGUESCENE585_MALE ADVENTURER_DIALOGUE11,I don't think any of us would have any issues with that.
1045132382227,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Good. Then follow me!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045132382228,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,(...)
1045132382229,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,"(So,...<waitfor=0.5>what were their names again?)"
1045132382230,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,(Pretty sure they told me.)
1045132382231,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,(Also pretty sure they told me their life stories and traits...which is kinda weird to tell a stranger.)
1045132382232,DIALOGUESCENE585_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,(Maybe I'll find that info on their <b>Character Pages(#KEY)</b>.)
1045132382233,DIALOGUESCENE586_FALKEN_DIALOGUE1,Hey Guild Master! Good news!
1045132382234,DIALOGUESCENE586_FALKEN_DIALOGUE2,"Since our adventurers saved that village from bandits, people have been starting to talk about us again."
1045132382235,DIALOGUESCENE586_FALKEN_DIALOGUE3,Mostly good things!
1045132382236,DIALOGUESCENE586_FALKEN_DIALOGUE4,And it's all thanks to you!
1045132382237,DIALOGUESCENE586_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,"Well, it's still too early to say that."
1045132382238,DIALOGUESCENE586_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,We're still nowhere near the reputation we used to have in the past.
1045132382239,DIALOGUESCENE586_FALKEN_DIALOGUE7,"Oh come on, Fiola!"
1045132382240,DIALOGUESCENE586_FALKEN_DIALOGUE8,It won't hurt to say something nice for a change.
1045132382241,DIALOGUESCENE586_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,(Now that's something I'd like to see.)
1045132382242,DIALOGUESCENE586_FIOLA_DIALOGUE10,...
1045132382243,DIALOGUESCENE586_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,I...
1045132382244,DIALOGUESCENE586_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,You...
1045132382245,DIALOGUESCENE586_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,<?shakeScreenWeak>Let's just get back to work!<?fadeOutNPC>
1045132382246,DIALOGUESCENE586_FALKEN_DIALOGUE14,"*sigh*...Good work, Guild Master."
1045132382247,DIALOGUESCENE586_FALKEN_DIALOGUE15, Someone ought to say that. Might as well be me.
1045132382248,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,"Hello, Guild Master."
1045132382249,DIALOGUESCENE587_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Oh hi, Majika. What can I do for you?"
1045132382250,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,I wanted to return this to you. I've completed my examination of its contents.
1045132382251,DIALOGUESCENE587_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>A notebook? What is this?
1045132382252,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,This is a notebook that was acquired by the adventurers during their expedition into the witch's sanctuary.
1045132382253,DIALOGUESCENE587_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"...<?shakeScreen> WHAT?!
Why wasn't I informed of this before?"
1045132382254,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,"My apologies, Guild Master. It so happened that the adventurers placed it in my custody by chance. My initial intent was to bring it to your attention promptly, but..."
1045132382255,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,...I was drawn into its contents.
1045132382256,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,"It was...captivating, Guild Master. Our knowledge of dark magic has been quite limited as few dare to delve into such a subject. This is the first written record I've come across that not only provides us with a basic understanding of this form of magic but also serves as a detailed manual on its usage."
1045132382257,DIALOGUESCENE587_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Wait...does that mean our adventurers could learn dark magic?
1045132382258,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE11,"It's entirely possible. However, the theories outlined in the notebook are rather intricate, and the absence of a demonic patron will likely complicate the learning process."
1045132382259,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,Only an exceptionally gifted individual would probably be able to grasp this magic.
1045132382260,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE13,"However,  if you happen to find such a talent, simply bring them to me, and I'll take it from there."
1045132382261,DIALOGUESCENE587_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,"That's good to know Majika, although I'm slightly hesitant about the fact it's dark magic."
1045132382262,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE15,"Guild Master, please remember that knowledge itself is inherently neutral, devoid of any morality."
1045132382263,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE16,It is the character and intent of the wielder that ultimately dictate its implications and consequences.
1045132382264,DIALOGUESCENE587_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"Hmmm...I guess you're right, Majika."
1045132382265,DIALOGUESCENE587_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE18,"Naturally, Guild Master."
1045132382266,DIALOGUESCENE588_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,"So, the adventurers weren't able to capture the disciple alive."
1045132382267,DIALOGUESCENE588_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Unfortunately not. She resisted until her last breath.
1045132382268,DIALOGUESCENE588_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"However, the adventurers found this amongst the disciple's belongings."
1045132382269,DIALOGUESCENE589_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,What is this?
1045132382270,DIALOGUESCENE589_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"I don't know, but it looks magical."
1045132382271,DIALOGUESCENE589_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,And I know somebody who I can ask about anything magical in nature.
1045132382272,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,"You summoned me, Guild Master?"
1045132382273,DIALOGUESCENE590_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2," Perfect timing, Majika! "
1045132382274,DIALOGUESCENE590_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Do you see this? Do you know what this might be?
1045132382275,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045132382276,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE5,How utterly intriguing!
1045132382277,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,A functioning piece of a navigation stone. I had believed that such artifacts had vanished from existence.
1045132382278,DIALOGUESCENE590_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,A navigation stone?
1045132382279,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,"These are magical stones, crafted by the ancient empyreans."
1045132382280,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,"Many have been unearthed during excavations, yet this is the first time where I witness one that appears to be in still operational condition."
1045132382281,DIALOGUESCENE590_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,What do those navigation stones do?
1045132382282,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE11,"They are imbued with an enchantment that eternally links them to a corresponding counterpart. One stone will always be attracted to another, permitting their holders to locate each other."
1045132382283,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,At least that's what the old records say.
1045132382284,DIALOGUESCENE590_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,"So, you're saying with this stone, we could find the location of its counterpart?"
1045132382285,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE14,"If you had paid attention to my previous elucidation, you would have discerned that I referred to it as a piece of a navigation stone. "
1045132382286,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE15,"Regrettably, this piece, in isolation, lacks the capability to offer guidance."
1045132382287,DIALOGUESCENE590_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE16,Could it be possible that the other disciples possess the remaining pieces?
1045132382288,DIALOGUESCENE590_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"That would make sense. Each one carrying a piece, and when they decide to return to their master, they meet up to rejoin the pieces. "
1045132382289,DIALOGUESCENE590_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,I guess we know now what to do next.
1045132382290,DIALOGUESCENE590_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,"Thanks, Majika."
1045132382291,DIALOGUESCENE590_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE20,"It was nothing, Guild Master."
1045132382292,DIALOGUESCENE591_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE1,...Her Holiness wants to see you.
1045132382293,DIALOGUESCENE591_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE2,Don't make her wait.<?fadeOutNPC>
1045132382294,DIALOGUESCENE591_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE3,...Nice seeing you too.
1045132382295,DIALOGUESCENE592_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE1,"Hello, Guild Master. Thank you for coming."
1045132382296,DIALOGUESCENE592_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Of course. How could I not? Your bodyguard always ask me so nicely.
"
1045132382297,DIALOGUESCENE592_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE3,...
1045132382298,DIALOGUESCENE592_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,"Really? I'm glad!
I was afraid you two might not get along."
1045132382299,DIALOGUESCENE592_BODYGUARD_DIALOGUE5,Y-your holiness...
1045132382300,DIALOGUESCENE592_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"(So, she does not understand sarcasm, huh?)"
1045132382301,DIALOGUESCENE593_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Well, whatever. I'm sure you didn't call me just to discuss my friendship with your bodyguard, did you?"
1045132382302,DIALOGUESCENE593_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,"Yes, of course. You're right."
1045132382303,DIALOGUESCENE593_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,I called you here because I wanted to let you know that we finally gained some information from the cultist we captured.
1045132382304,DIALOGUESCENE593_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Does that mean we now know where the witch is?
1045132382305,DIALOGUESCENE593_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,"...No, unfortunately not. It seems that the witch is more careful than that. Most of the cultists have never met the witch and don't know how to find her."
1045132382306,DIALOGUESCENE593_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"""Most""?"
1045132382307,DIALOGUESCENE593_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE7,"It seems the witch has disciples, powerful mages who wander the lands as her proxies. One of the few people with direct contact to her."
1045132382308,DIALOGUESCENE593_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Do we know where these disciples are?
1045132382309,DIALOGUESCENE593_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE9,No. But they will most likely be much easier to find than the witch herself.
1045132382310,DIALOGUESCENE593_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Can't the gods just locate them for us?
1045132382311,DIALOGUESCENE593_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE11,"Unfortunately, ever since the last quest, the demon lords have started to interfere with the gods' sight in the mortal realm. We have to find them on our own."
1045132382312,DIALOGUESCENE593_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"*sighs* Of course, it wouldn't be that easy. I guess we have to do it the old-fashioned way. "
1045132382313,DIALOGUESCENE593_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Any ideas on where we need to look?
1045132382314,DIALOGUESCENE593_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE14,"It's very likely they will try to find more allies amongst the enemies of humanity, just like before. We should look if any of those groups show signs of demonic involvement."
1045132382315,DIALOGUESCENE593_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"Alright, I'll send some adventurers to search."
1045132382316,DIALOGUESCENE593_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE16,"Thank you, Guild Master. Hopefully, not much longer, and we can put an end to the witch."
1045132382317,DIALOGUESCENE594_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045132382318,DIALOGUESCENE594_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(...Where am I?)
1045132382319,DIALOGUESCENE594_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,(...It's so dark...)
1045132382320,DIALOGUESCENE594_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>Hello Guild Master.
1045132382321,DIALOGUESCENE595_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>!!!!
1045132382322,DIALOGUESCENE595_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE2,"Relax, Guild Master. I'm just here to talk."
1045132382323,DIALOGUESCENE595_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,W-Where are we? And who are you?
1045132382324,DIALOGUESCENE595_MYSTERIOUS WOMAN_DIALOGUE4,"This is your dream, Guild Master. I'm merely using it as a way to communicate with you just as I did with your predecessor."
1045132382325,DIALOGUESCENE595_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?whiteFlash>Wait...Are you...?
1045132382326,DIALOGUESCENE595_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE6,"Yes, I'm the Demon Witch. Chosen of the demon lords."
1045132382327,DIALOGUESCENE595_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...
1045132382328,DIALOGUESCENE595_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"So, what? Are you here to kill me in my sleep?"
1045132382329,DIALOGUESCENE595_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE9,"No, Guild Master. If I could do that, we wouldn't even have this conversation."
1045132382330,DIALOGUESCENE595_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,(Scary...)
1045132382331,DIALOGUESCENE595_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE11,I'm just here to give you a friendly warning.
1045132382332,DIALOGUESCENE595_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE12,There is no reason for you to get involved in this matter between the gods and the demon lords. You're just being used in a proxy war.
1045132382333,DIALOGUESCENE595_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE13,So I advise you to stop interfering.
1045132382334,DIALOGUESCENE595_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Or else?
1045132382335,DIALOGUESCENE595_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE15,Or else this time we won't stop until there is nothing left of the Adventurer Guild.
1045132382336,DIALOGUESCENE596_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash><?shakeScreen>!!!
1045132382337,DIALOGUESCENE596_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...
1045132382338,DIALOGUESCENE597_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>!!!!
1045132382339,DIALOGUESCENE597_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Your holiness?
1045132382340,DIALOGUESCENE597_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Divine Messenger?
1045132382341,DIALOGUESCENE597_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Very rude bodyguard?
1045132382342,DIALOGUESCENE597_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,(They're gone...Did we lose them somewhere?)
1045132382343,DIALOGUESCENE597_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,(...I guess we have no choice than to continue without them.)
1045132382344,DIALOGUESCENE598_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,Who would have guessed that there was an empyrean ruin underground? Majika is going to hate it that she isn't with us right now.
1045132382345,DIALOGUESCENE598_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>Focus Guild Master!
1045132382346,DIALOGUESCENE598_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE3,We're here to find the Witch and put an end to her and her cult.
1045132382347,DIALOGUESCENE598_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE4,Not much longer and it's finally over.
1045132382348,DIALOGUESCENE598_DIVINE MESSENGER_DIALOGUE5,Let us move on!
1045132382349,DIALOGUESCENE599_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"We need to talk, {PROTAGONIST}!"
1045132382350,DIALOGUESCENE599_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...Do we?
1045132382351,DIALOGUESCENE599_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,<?shakeScreen>Get serious! What are we going to do about the Witch?
1045132382352,DIALOGUESCENE599_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,"It has been days since we've locked her up.
Why are we still keeping her here?"
1045132382353,DIALOGUESCENE599_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"I don't know, and the only person who could answer the question has locked herself up in her room and hasn't come out."
1045132382354,DIALOGUESCENE599_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,So what now?
1045132382355,DIALOGUESCENE599_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"I was actually planning on visiting the witch. There's still a lot we don't know about, and maybe she'll have the answers."
1045132382356,DIALOGUESCENE599_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,"For example, why are the gods searching for a body?"
1045132382357,DIALOGUESCENE599_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,Wasn't this whole conflict about the safeguarding of human souls?
1045132382358,DIALOGUESCENE599_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,I don't believe it's the whole truth.
1045132382359,DIALOGUESCENE599_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,*Sighs* Why can't things ever be straightforward?
1045132382360,DIALOGUESCENE599_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,I'm actually going to see her right now.
1045132382361,DIALOGUESCENE599_FIOLA_DIALOGUE13,...I'll come too.
1045132382362,DIALOGUESCENE599_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,Suit yourself.
1045132382363,DIALOGUESCENE600_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,I still can't believe we have one of these.
1045132382364,DIALOGUESCENE600_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"This used to be a military fortress. So, I don't think it's out of place. I'm more surprised that you never discovered these before."
1045132382365,DIALOGUESCENE600_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,This fortress has more space than we actually use. There was just never a need to explore any more of it.
1045132382366,DIALOGUESCENE600_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...
1045132382367,DIALOGUESCENE600_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,...We're here.
1045132382368,DIALOGUESCENE601_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE1,...
1045132382369,DIALOGUESCENE601_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Hello, miss witch. Or do you have a name you'd prefer?"
1045132382370,DIALOGUESCENE601_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE3,...
1045132382371,DIALOGUESCENE601_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Witch, it is, I guess."
1045136576512,DIALOGUESCENE601_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Now, I have some questions for you, and I'd appreciate it if you'd answer them."
1045136576513,DIALOGUESCENE601_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,Who is this emperor the gods are looking for?
1045136576514,DIALOGUESCENE601_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE7,...
1045136576515,DIALOGUESCENE601_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,Why is it so important for them to find his body?
1045136576516,DIALOGUESCENE601_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE9,...
1045136576517,DIALOGUESCENE601_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,"The silent treatment, huh?"
1045136576518,DIALOGUESCENE601_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11, You better talk...or I'll hurt you until you do.
1045136576519,DIALOGUESCENE602_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"<?shakeScreen>WAIT A SECOND!
You'll do nothing of that sort!"
1045136576520,DIALOGUESCENE602_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,"The Adventurer Guild is not a place where we do anything like that!
Fran would never allow that!"
1045136576521,DIALOGUESCENE602_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"...Thanks for ruining it, Fiola. I was obviously bluffing!"
1045136576522,DIALOGUESCENE602_FIOLA_DIALOGUE4,As if that would have worked!
1045136576523,DIALOGUESCENE602_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"<?shakeScreen>Well, sorry, but as an ex-adventurer, threatening people with violence is the best I can do in terms of interrogations!"
1045136576524,DIALOGUESCENE602_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,What else do I have? Begging?
1045136576525,DIALOGUESCENE602_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Hey, witch! If you don't talk, you'll see somebody at my age cry like a little baby! Do you really want to see that?"
1045136576526,DIALOGUESCENE602_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,I'd actually love to see that.
1045136576527,DIALOGUESCENE602_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"Oh, just be quiet! Or I tell everyone in the Guild how your first date with Fran ended! "
1045136576528,DIALOGUESCENE602_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE10,Spoiler alert: It was unbelievably embarrassing.
1045136576529,DIALOGUESCENE602_FIOLA_DIALOGUE11,<?shakeScreen>H-how do you know that?
1045136576530,DIALOGUESCENE602_FIOLA_DIALOGUE12,Wait...did you spy on us?
1045136576531,DIALOGUESCENE602_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE13,Oops...that backfired quickly...
1045136576532,DIALOGUESCENE602_FIOLA_DIALOGUE14,<?shakeScreen>I will **** kill you!
1045136576533,DIALOGUESCENE602_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"Wait!
Can't you find it in your infinitely small heart...<?shakeScreen>ouch!"
1045136576534,DIALOGUESCENE603_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE1,...<?whiteFlash>Is this all just a joke for you?
1045136576535,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(She's talking.)
1045136576536,DIALOGUESCENE603_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE3,You really have no idea what's going on.
1045136576537,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"...Apparently, we don't. So why don't you tell us?"
1045136576538,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,Maybe I'd even be on your side if I knew what was going on.
1045136576539,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Although I highly doubt it, considering your side is kidnapping and sacrificing humans."
1045136576540,DIALOGUESCENE603_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE7,...There is a reason for that...
1045136576541,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,No kidding! And here I was thinking you were doing it for shit and giggles.
1045136576542,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,"What's the reason?
What could possibly justify what you're doing?"
1045136576543,DIALOGUESCENE603_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE10,...
1045136576544,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,"Silence again, huh? 
Fine. I had enough for today, anyway."
1045136576545,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,"We'll continue the conversation another day. I'll be sleeping soundly tonight, knowing people won't get sacrificed."
1045136576546,DIALOGUESCENE603_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE13,"Me being here makes no difference. Even without me, my comrades will continue to work for his..."
1045136576547,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...For his what?
1045136576548,DIALOGUESCENE603_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE15,...
1045136576549,DIALOGUESCENE603_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,*Sighs*. Let's go Fiola.
1045136576550,DIALOGUESCENE604_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,This was just a waste of time.
1045136576551,DIALOGUESCENE604_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"...Not entirely.
First, we know capturing the witch didn't stop the cult. 
Second, both the witch and the gods are hiding something from us."
1045136576552,DIALOGUESCENE604_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"I wonder if it's the same secret.
If it is, then it's strange how both sides are trying to hide it. One would assume that one side would benefit from revealing it."
1045136576553,DIALOGUESCENE604_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Well, no point in thinking about it with so few clues. We can only hope that next time she'll talk more.
Alright, I'm heading out, Fiola.<?fadeOutNPC>"
1045136576554,DIALOGUESCENE605_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Wait! I'm still not done with you regarding the spying!
1045136576555,DIALOGUESCENE605_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Sorry! Can't hear you! I'm too far away already!
1045136576556,DIALOGUESCENE605_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,"Hnggh!!!
Come back!"
1045136576557,DIALOGUESCENE606_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,I think it's time we talk with the witch again.
1045136576558,DIALOGUESCENE606_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"Alright.
Let's go."
1045136576559,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,"<?whiteFlash>Ah, greetings, Guild Master. And also to you, Miss Fiola."
1045136576560,DIALOGUESCENE607_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Majika? What brings you here?
1045136576561,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,I've grown interested in your prisoner after hearing about her from the adventurers who captured her.
1045136576562,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,"Is it true that the gods were inquiring about an ""Emperor""?"
1045136576563,DIALOGUESCENE607_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"Yes. I was there when it happened. Although, I have no idea who they might be referring to."
1045136576564,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,"Guild Master, do you comprehend the full extent of the term ""Emperor""?"
1045136576565,DIALOGUESCENE607_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Isn't it just another word for a king? A ruler?
1045136576566,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE8,"It's understandable that one would have such an interpretation of it in present time, given that its original meaning is not applicable to the current political landscape. "
1045136576567,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,"However, the term's origin lies in an era when the conventional titles of king or queen proved insufficient. This occurred during a period when an expansive empire necessitated a designation surpassing that of monarchs."
1045136576568,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE10,Such a circumstance arose only once in history.
1045136576569,DIALOGUESCENE607_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,The Empyreans...
1045136576570,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,Precisely. I trust you now comprehend the reason behind my curiosity with your captive. It appears highly probable that the cult has some ties with the ancient empire.
1045136576571,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE13,"I had hoped she might offer valuable knowledge, yet regrettably, she proves to be rather uncooperative."
1045136576572,DIALOGUESCENE607_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,I wanted to talk to her anyway. Maybe she'll respond to me.
1045136576573,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE15,One can only hope.
1045136576574,DIALOGUESCENE607_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE16,...
1045136576575,DIALOGUESCENE607_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE17,"I see you've already met a friend of mine. She's very interested in the history of the Empyreans.
So, it would mean a lot to her if you could share anything you might know."
1045136576576,DIALOGUESCENE607_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE18,...Go screw yourself.
1045136576577,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE19,"...It appears her disposition towards you is no more favorable than it is towards myself. In fact, it seems to be even less so."
1045136576578,DIALOGUESCENE607_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE20,"Thanks for the helpful insight, Majika..."
1045136576579,DIALOGUESCENE607_FIOLA_DIALOGUE21,I don't think she will be sharing whatever connection the cult might have with the Empyreans.
1045136576580,DIALOGUESCENE607_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE22,"Regrettable. However, I do harbor a theory I wish to expound upon.
"
1045136576581,DIALOGUESCENE608_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,A theory?
1045136576582,DIALOGUESCENE608_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE2,"Indeed. Firstly, are you certain that the gods posed the question, ""Where's the Emperor's body?"""
1045136576583,DIALOGUESCENE608_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Hmmm...Yes. 
I'm very certain that's what they said."
1045136576584,DIALOGUESCENE608_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,"So, they did not specify a particular name?"
1045136576585,DIALOGUESCENE608_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,No...Not that I can remember. Does that matter?
1045136576586,DIALOGUESCENE608_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,"It does, Guild Master. In all scholarly examinations of the Empyreans, it is evident that their empire endured for over a millennium."
1045136576587,DIALOGUESCENE608_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE7,"Therefore, it stands to reason that numerous Emperors ruled over their realm.  However, the gods referenced only the title as though the identity they're refering to was self-evident."
1045136576588,DIALOGUESCENE608_FIOLA_DIALOGUE8,That does seem weird...
1045136576589,DIALOGUESCENE608_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE9,"Perhaps less so for scholars well versed in Empyrean history. Across all found records, the Emperor is never denoted by name. Scholars theorized that this convention may have been rooted in tradition, possibly as an act of reverence or respect for the imperial title."
1045136576590,DIALOGUESCENE608_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE10,"However, I have an alternative hypothesis."
1045136576591,DIALOGUESCENE609_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE1,What if... there was never a necessity to differentiate? What if there existed only one emperor throughout the empire's existence?
1045136576592,DIALOGUESCENE609_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Wait...You cannot be suggesting...
1045136576593,DIALOGUESCENE609_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE3,"Indeed, Guild Master. What if, throughout the empire's duration until its mysterious disappearance, it was governed by a singular ruler?"
1045136576594,DIALOGUESCENE609_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE4,It would also serve as an explanation for the unusual stability of the Empire despite its size. An absence of instability due to the transfer of power.
1045136576595,DIALOGUESCENE609_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,But a person like that would be hundreds of years old! No one could possibly live that long!
1045136576596,DIALOGUESCENE609_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE6,"This is where the involvement of demon lords becomes apparent. 
A pact with demons for immortality seems entirely characteristic for them, does it not?"
1045136576597,DIALOGUESCENE609_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...But aren't deals with demon lords paid in souls? Does that mean the Empyrean Emperor has been sacrificing souls of people to...
1045136576598,DIALOGUESCENE610_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE1,<?shakeScreen>Don't you dare say it!
1045136576599,DIALOGUESCENE610_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,(It seems like we hit a nerve.)
1045136576600,DIALOGUESCENE610_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"I guess Majika really hit close to home, didn't she?
So how much about what she theorized is true? Maybe everything?"
1045136576601,DIALOGUESCENE610_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,Did the emperor made deals with the demon lords and sacrifice...
1045136576602,DIALOGUESCENE610_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE5,<?shakeScreen>He never forced anyone! They all volunteered!
1045136576603,DIALOGUESCENE610_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"...Volunteered? To be sacrificed? You can't actually believe that, do you?"
1045136576604,DIALOGUESCENE610_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE7,"<?shakeScreen>They did! Each of them did!
They...they..."
1045136576605,DIALOGUESCENE610_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE8,...
1045136576606,DIALOGUESCENE610_FIOLA_DIALOGUE9,...Why are you talking about that as if you were there? Don't tell me you're also...
1045136576607,DIALOGUESCENE610_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE10,...
1045136576608,DIALOGUESCENE610_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE11,Of course! It stands to reason that the individual directly chosen by the demon lords could negotiate for immortality. 
1045136576609,DIALOGUESCENE610_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE12,Could you perhaps be the link between the emperor and the demon lords? The one who brought him their powers?
1045136576610,DIALOGUESCENE610_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE13,"<?shakeScreen>Shut up! Shut up!
<?shakeScreen>You know nothing!"
1045136576611,DIALOGUESCENE610_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,...I think we're done for today.
1045136576612,DIALOGUESCENE610_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE15,"Majika, I think you can mark your theory as very likely to be true."
1045136576613,DIALOGUESCENE610_MAJIKA_DIALOGUE16,How fascinating. I need to re-analyze everything I thought I knew about the Empyreans in light of this new revelation.
1045136576614,DIALOGUESCENE610_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE17,...
1045136576615,DIALOGUESCENE611_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Well, we now know who the Emperor is. 
But we still don't know 'why'."
1045136576616,DIALOGUESCENE611_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,Why are the gods looking for the body of a man who has existed such a long time ago?
1045136576617,DIALOGUESCENE611_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,...It looked like the Emperor was an important person to her.
1045136576618,DIALOGUESCENE611_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"It seemed so...
Maybe I can make use of it next time we're there."
1045136576619,DIALOGUESCENE612_FIOLA_DIALOGUE1,"It's time again, {PROTAGONIST}."
1045136576620,DIALOGUESCENE612_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,*Sighs* Alright. Let's go.
1045136576621,DIALOGUESCENE613_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,"Alright, another day of interrogation.
So? Are you feeling like talking today?"
1045136576622,DIALOGUESCENE613_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE2,...
1045136576623,DIALOGUESCENE613_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,Of course you don't.
1045136576624,DIALOGUESCENE613_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,"Last time, you seemed quite defensive about the emperor, although I have no idea why."
1045136576625,DIALOGUESCENE613_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"An immortal Emperor who ruled over his lands for over a thousand years, sacrificing his subjects to extend his own life? That sounds like a tyrant to me."
1045136576626,DIALOGUESCENE613_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE6,... That's because you know nothing of him.
1045136576627,DIALOGUESCENE613_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,Then enlighten me. What kind of person was he?
1045136576628,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE1,"... He was the greatest man I've known. In all my years, I've never encountered another person like him."
1045136576629,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE2,There was a time when the lands were split into hundreds of small kingdoms and tribes constantly warring with each other. The people suffered greatly in those times.
1045136576630,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE3,"The emperor was the one who put a stop to it. A young conqueror, not driven by greed, but a vision to end his people's suffering."
1045136576631,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE4,"He was a kind-hearted man, often putting his life on the line for the people under him. 
And in response the people followed him with unwavering loyalty."
1045136576632,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,How did you meet him?
1045136576633,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE6,"He conquered my tribe, or to be more precise,...he destroyed it."
1045136576634,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"Strange way to start a relationship, but go on."
1045136576635,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE8,My tribe was... evil. They worshipped the demon lords and did horrible things to smaller tribes. They just reaped what they sowed.
1045136576636,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,What about you? How come you were spared?
1045136576637,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE10,...The emperor said that he could see that I wasn't like them. That I never wanted to be part of any of that.
1045136576638,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,...Say that to your recent victims.
1045136576639,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE12,<?shakeScreen>If I had any other choice then...
1045136576640,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE13,...
1045136576641,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE14,"...I followed him from that day on.
When I realized how great of a man he was, I swore my loyalty to him."
1045136576642,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE15,"I was by his side when he was still just an upstart conqueror. I was there when he defeated his last enemies and united the lands.
And I continued to be by his side in all those centuries he ruled over the empire."
1045136576643,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE16,... Were you two a couple?
1045136576644,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE17,"... Don't be foolish. We were both from completely different standings. He was the emperor, and I belonged to a tribe that worshipped demons. 
He married once in his lifetime. Only once however..."
1045136576645,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE18,"He sounds like a great guy.
Certainly not like a guy who would make deals with demon lords."
1045136576646,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE19,"But he did, didn't he?"
1045136576647,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE20,"There was... no other choice. None of his children had the same leadership skills as he, and they were close to tearing the empire apart in a civil war."
1045136576648,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE21,"That's why...I told him about the way to extend his life. 
...I told him about the demon lords."
1045136576649,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE22,"He was reluctant to do it, but he did it for his people. Many loyal servants sacrificed their lives so he could rule the empire longer. "
1045136576650,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE23,"And he responded to it. 
His whole life was dedicated to his people, doing everything in his power to lead the empire to everlasting prosperity."
1045136576651,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE24,"But in the end, the empire still perished, didn't it?"
1045136576652,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE25,How did that happen?
1045136576653,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE26,...
1045136576654,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE27,And all of that still doesn't explain why the gods are so interested in his remains.
1045136576655,DIALOGUESCENE614_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE28,...
1045136576656,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE29,"Don't want to answer anymore, huh?
Well, fine."
1045136576657,DIALOGUESCENE614_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE30,Let's just treat this like an interesting history lesson and continue some other time.
1045136576658,DIALOGUESCENE615_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,I'm starting to think this is getting us nowhere.
1045136576659,DIALOGUESCENE615_FIOLA_DIALOGUE2,...You need to talk with the Divine Messenger.
1045136576660,DIALOGUESCENE615_FIOLA_DIALOGUE3,I think only the gods have the answers we seek.
1045136576661,DIALOGUESCENE615_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,...The Divine Messenger still refuses to come out. She still needs time.
1045136576662,DIALOGUESCENE615_FIOLA_DIALOGUE5,How much longer can we wait?
1045136576663,DIALOGUESCENE615_FIOLA_DIALOGUE6,I don't know why...but I have the terrifying feeling that something terrible will happen and we're completely blind...
1045136576664,DIALOGUESCENE615_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...You're not the only one.
1045136576665,DIALOGUESCENE616_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,(I need to talk with the witch. It's better if I go alone this time.)
1045136576666,DIALOGUESCENE617_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...I know that you're trying to resurrect the Emperor.
1045136576667,DIALOGUESCENE617_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE2,...So the gods have told you everything.
1045136576668,DIALOGUESCENE617_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"Yes. Although, I still don't understand your motivations for doing all this.
You're messing with forces that could doom us all."
1045136576669,DIALOGUESCENE617_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE4,...
1045136576670,DIALOGUESCENE617_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,"<?shakeScreen>Oh come on! 
Now is not the time to stay silent!"
1045136576671,DIALOGUESCENE617_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE6,...I'm not the one you should be talking to.
1045136576672,DIALOGUESCENE617_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,(She reaches out a hand to me.)
1045136576673,DIALOGUESCENE617_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE8,"Take my hand, Guild Master.
He wants to talk with you."
1045136576674,DIALOGUESCENE617_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,<?whiteFlash>He? You don't mean...
1045136576675,DIALOGUESCENE617_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE10,Take my hand.
1045136576676,DIALOGUESCENE617_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE11,...(I take her hand.)
1045140770816,DIALOGUESCENE618_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...Where am I?
1045140770817,DIALOGUESCENE619_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>It's a space the demon lords have created for us to talk in private.
1045140770818,DIALOGUESCENE619_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...And you are...
1045140770819,DIALOGUESCENE619_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE3,I'm the Emperor.
1045140770820,DIALOGUESCENE619_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE4,<?whiteFlash>!!!
1045140770821,DIALOGUESCENE619_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE5,"It's time that we talked. 
You and your Guild have proven themselves to be quite the thorn in my side."
1045140770822,DIALOGUESCENE619_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE6,"You've been formidable enemies. 
However, you don't have to be."
1045140770823,DIALOGUESCENE619_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,"I feel like I do, considering that what you've done could put the world in danger."
1045140770824,DIALOGUESCENE619_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE8,Because I've sealed one of the seven gods?
1045140770825,DIALOGUESCENE619_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>!!!
1045140770826,DIALOGUESCENE619_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE10,"Be at ease, Guild Master. My deal with the demon lords forbids them from spying on me. And they never break a deal made with mortals.
That's the only commendable thing about them. "
1045140770827,DIALOGUESCENE619_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE11,"Anything we discuss here, stays between us, and I also have a vested interest to not let them know about the gods' moment of weakness."
1045140770828,DIALOGUESCENE619_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE12,Then you know about...
1045140770829,DIALOGUESCENE619_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE13,"Yes. I'm aware of the power balance between the gods and the demon lords.
As well as the ramification of the demon lords learning the truth."
1045140770830,DIALOGUESCENE619_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE14,<?shakeScreen>Then why are you doing all of this?
1045140770831,DIALOGUESCENE620_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE1,"...
<?whiteFlash>Tell me, Guild Master, what do you think about the brokered peace between the gods and the demon lords?"
1045140770832,DIALOGUESCENE620_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE2,What do you think about the fact that the gods are content with the fact that many souls will always inevitably end in the demon lords' hands?
1045140770833,DIALOGUESCENE620_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE3,"The fact that they want our reverence and dedications, despite not willing to fight to save our souls from damnation."
1045140770834,DIALOGUESCENE620_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE4,The gods have failed in their duties towards humanity by buying a truce with human souls.
1045140770835,DIALOGUESCENE620_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,That's rich coming from the guy who bought his immortality and now even his resurrection with human souls.
1045140770836,DIALOGUESCENE620_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE6,"A sacrifice which pains me dearly.
But it will be worth it, because I plan to end it all."
1045140770837,DIALOGUESCENE620_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE7,...What are you talking about?
1045140770838,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE1,"If the gods aren't willing to fight then I will.
I will use the sealed goddess to become a god myself!"
1045140770839,DIALOGUESCENE621_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,<?shakeScreen>I-is that even possible?
1045140770840,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE3,"You underestimate me, Guild Master, just like the gods. Their mistake is what brought them into this situation. "
1045140770841,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE4,"There is nothing that I cannot accomplish.
"
1045140770842,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE5,I will become the 7th god and start a war against the demon lords. I will break their peace and start the war that will forever free us from the clutches of the demons.
1045140770843,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE6,"And when the demon lords are finally vanquished, I will subjugate the gods. 
They have proven themselves to be unworthy to lead humanity."
1045140770844,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE7,"No. It's only I who can become humanity's one true ruler. 
There will be no more pain, no more conflicts, no more damnations. Only prosperity and peace."
1045140770845,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE8,Because I have willed it.
1045140770846,DIALOGUESCENE621_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE9,<?shakeScreen>That's...insane! What will happen to the world if a war erupts between the Gods and the Demon Lords?
1045140770847,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE10,"The world will burn, but from its ashes, a new and better one will be born."
1045140770848,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE11,"<?shakeScreen>Stop fighting me, Guild Master! I'm not your enemy. You have lived long enough to see this world's shortcomings."
1045140770849,DIALOGUESCENE621_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE12,"You should know that humanity deserved better.
Serve me and help me forge a world of greater virtue and prosperity."
1045140770850,DIALOGUESCENE622_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE1,...I'm sure even your old friend Fran would have agreed if he knew my true goals.
1045140770851,DIALOGUESCENE622_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,...Fran?
1045140770852,DIALOGUESCENE622_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE3,"Yes. Despite our Opposition to each other, I remember the former Guild Master as a virtuous and noble soul.
A pity he died before he could learn the truth."
1045140770853,DIALOGUESCENE622_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE4,"However, I am convinced that if he had known, then he would have been on my side."
1045140770854,DIALOGUESCENE623_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...You know nothing about him.
1045140770855,DIALOGUESCENE623_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE2,"He would have never agreed to any of this. We always knew how hard life could be.
Everyone deserved better."
1045140770856,DIALOGUESCENE623_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"However, they also deserved to not be dragged into your mad crusade!"
1045140770857,DIALOGUESCENE624_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE1,"...How regrettable that you couldn't see reason.  But it matters little. 
My followers have nearly completed the deal with the demon lords and my resurrection is close at hand."
1045140770858,DIALOGUESCENE624_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE2,You will not be able to stop me then.
1045140770859,DIALOGUESCENE624_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,"<?shakeScreen>I will find where the goddess is hidden before that! 
I promise you that!"
1045140770860,DIALOGUESCENE624_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE4,"I doubt that. 
My forces will come and destroy you before that happens."
1045140770861,DIALOGUESCENE624_THE EMPEROR_DIALOGUE5,And your captive won't be able to tell you anything.
1045140770862,DIALOGUESCENE624_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,<?shakeScreen>W-what?!
1045140770863,DIALOGUESCENE625_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,<?whiteFlash>...(I'm back.)
1045140770864,DIALOGUESCENE625_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE2,...
1045140770865,DIALOGUESCENE625_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,...Is everything alright?
1045140770866,DIALOGUESCENE625_DEMON WITCH_DIALOGUE4,<?grayFlash>...
1045140770867,DIALOGUESCENE625_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE5,<?fadeOutNPC>(She collapses to the ground.)
1045140770868,DIALOGUESCENE626_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE1,...
1045140770869,DIALOGUESCENE626_EDEN_DIALOGUE2,"<?whiteFlash>I've done my best, Guild master. She might be able to pull through."
1045140770870,DIALOGUESCENE626_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE3,What happened to her? She suddenly just started bleeding.
1045140770871,DIALOGUESCENE626_EDEN_DIALOGUE4,"It seems like some sort of curse was activated on her. Fortunately, you brought her here fast enough for us to remove it before any lasting damage could be done. "
1045140770872,DIALOGUESCENE626_EDEN_DIALOGUE5,"For now, she only needs time to recover."
1045140770873,DIALOGUESCENE626_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE6,"Unfortunately, time is the one thing we don't have much."
1045140770874,DIALOGUESCENE626_EDEN_DIALOGUE7,"I'm sorry, Guild master. But there is nothing else we can do."
1045140770875,DIALOGUESCENE626_GUILDMASTER_DIALOGUE8,...Inform me immediately when she's in condition to talk again.
1045140770876,DIALOGUESCENE626_EDEN_DIALOGUE9,"Yes, Guild Master!"
10862643286016,SIDESTORY0,最后的告别
10862660063232,SIDESTORY0_DIARYENTRY,"自从弗兰去世的消息传来已经好几个星期了。至今我仍然没有完全接受这个事实。有时我会想，如果我转个弯，他会突然出现在那里，微笑着跟我打招呼，告诉我这一切只是为了见我而开的一个可怕玩笑。

但我知道这不是。 "
10862660063233,SIDESTORY1,女巫与我
10862660063234,SIDESTORY1_DIARYENTRY,我从来不明白弗兰怎么会爱上那个叫“菲奥拉”的恶毒女人。即使在十多年没有见面后，我觉得我们之间似乎没有任何变化。 
10862660063235,SIDESTORY2,Tavi The Tavernkeeper
10862660063236,SIDESTORY2_DIARYENTRY,我得承认，我是个非常喜欢喝酒的人，即使我通常不喜欢在公司里喝酒。这就是为什么我通常在大多数人已经入睡的时候喝酒。到那时，酒馆老板是我唯一剩下的陪伴。 
10862660063237,SIDESTORY3,A Meal For The Priest
10862660063238,SIDESTORY3_DIARYENTRY,最近，似乎伊登过于专注于他的职责，忽视了自己的健康。显然，他已经有一段时间没有好好吃饭了，诺拉对此感到非常担心。 
10862660063239,SIDESTORY4,Alchemical Addiction
10862660063240,SIDESTORY4_DIARYENTRY,"Emily always seemed passionate about her work as an alchemist. I mean, this is the girl who left home to search for a mystical plant, after all. But I had no idea just how deeply her passion ran until that day."
10862660063241,SIDESTORY5,Suspicious Behaviour
10862660063242,SIDESTORY5_DIARYENTRY,"It gives me a great deal of headache that there are people in the Guild who are still an enigma to me. Rogue and Me'can, two people of whom I know neither their real name nor their faces. But I wasn't the only one bothered by their anonymity."
10862660063243,SIDESTORY6,Soft Core
10862660063244,SIDESTORY6_DIARYENTRY,"The first impression I got from Astrid was that she was a solitary and unsociable woman. She keeps to herself and doesn't seem to have any close friends or family. When I see the way the she looks at people, I recognize the expression of someone who held no expectations to people. It's no wonder that everyone keeps their distance to her. Except for one."
10862660063245,SIDESTORY7,Family life
10862660063246,SIDESTORY7_DIARYENTRY,"I don't know many people with a family life, let alone a happy one. The harsh realities of our profession often leave little room for personal connections, and many who seek a family may never live long enough to have one. And even those who do live long enough end up unable to share their life with another person."
10862660063247,SIDESTORY8,Don't translate
10862660063248,SIDESTORY8_DIARYENTRY,Don't translate
10862660063249,SIDESTORY9,The Good Man
10862660063250,SIDESTORY9_DIARYENTRY,"I'm not entirely nihilistic; I do believe there are genuinely good people in this world. Franny was such a person. However, Zoldak is in a category of his own. Sometimes I find myself wondering what motivates him to try so hard."
10862660063251,SIDESTORY10,Rogue's and Luana's Past
10862660063252,SIDESTORY10_DIARYENTRY,"From the first moment I saw Rogue and Luana interacting with each other, I could tell that they were close. At first glance, one might not think so. Luana, a former accomplished knight from a noble lineage and Rogue, a mysterious woman with a dark and questionable past, seemed like two people from entirely different worlds."
10862660063253,SIDESTORY11,Intervention
10862660063254,SIDESTORY11_DIARYENTRY,I've never seen a person in my life drink as much alcohol as Bai did...and it's starting to become a problem.
10862660063255,SIDESTORY12,Vincent and Women
10862660063256,SIDESTORY12_DIARYENTRY,"It wasn't surprising for me to learn that Vincent had many admirers amongst the female adventurers, considering how he treated each one he met. What did surprise me was something entirely else..."
