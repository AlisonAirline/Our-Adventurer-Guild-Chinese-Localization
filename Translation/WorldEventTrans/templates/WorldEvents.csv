Among these groups, one party stood out from the rest. Their equipment gleamed with the highest quality that money could buy, matched only by the radiant confidence they exudedâ€”a confidence that could only be acquired through years of battle-hardened experience.

The dragon let out a weak laugh. ""How unfortunate for you, bard, that my time is coming to an end. For me, however, I welcome it. I have lived for far too long, and it's a blessing to meet my demise in battle before age has claimed me.""

The dragon's gaze settled upon the adventurers. ""Oh, mighty warriors. Inside my body, you will find an orb that can bestow upon you a portion of a dragon's power. Accept this gift, and may your foes quiver in terror."" With those words, the dragon's voice faded into silence, marking its final moments.

As the dragon had requested, the adventurers started the task of dismantling the mighty creature."
1834453781352449,WORLDEVENT81_PAGE1,"The adventurers and Bai finally found the swordsman they were looking for. Upon spotting the man, Bai displayed an unusual expressionâ€”a troubled one.

The swordsman was a man with long black hair, wearing a simple white mask covering part of his face. His appearance and attire bore a resemblance to Bai and the adventurers wondered if there was any connection between the two.

""Ugh... It's you,"" Bai said, her tone tinged with annoyance. ""I got excited for nothing.""

""Bai, Bai, Bai..."" the man began, adopting a theatrical demeanor. ""How could you just leave the village without telling me? You're breaking my heart,"" he quipped while dramatically clutching his chest. ""I was afraid I would never see you again, but luckily for me, I knew exactly how to catch your attention.""

"
1834453781352450,WORLDEVENT81_PAGE2,"It became evident to the adventurers that the swordsman had been challenging swordmasters across the country, all in a bid to draw out Bai. But the question remained: for what purpose?

""What do you want, Shen?"" Bai inquired, losing interest by the minute.

""You know what I want, Bai!"" Shen responded, drawing his sword gracefully from its sheath and adopting a poised fighting stance. ""I want to settle the matter between us! Fight me!""

However, in stark contrast to Shen, who had readied himself for a fight, Bai simply stood there apathetically. Then, to the surprise of the adventurers, she gave an unexpected answer:

""No!"""
1834453781352451,WORLDEVENT81_PAGE3,"""You can't run from me forever, Bai!"" Shen exclaimed. ""You will have to fight me!""

""I've told you already."" Bai responded, "" If Yu wants me defeated, he should do it himself."" For a moment, the swordsman seemed troubled by Bai's words.

""It doesn't matter whether Yu or I defeat you. It's the same thing.""

""It's not,"" Bai retorted, growing increasingly irritated. ""Just take off the damn mask!""

The adventurers couldn't quite follow the conversation anymore. Who was this Yu, and why did he want to see Bai defeated?
"
1834453781352452,WORLDEVENT81RESULT0_PAGE1,"""Enough! I went to great lengths to find you! I will not let you leave until I've had my fight!"" Shen declared, his tone leaving no room for further arguments. Bai appeared troubled, an uncharacteristic look on her face, and her hesitation added to the oddity of the situation â€“ for some reason she didn't seem to want to engage in a battle with the swordsman.

Then, a sudden smile broke across Bai's face, her expression shifting in a way that sent an uneasy feeling rippling through the adventurers.

""Fine, you can have your fight. Against them!"" She pointed directly at the adventurers, who couldn't help but groan in response.

""If you can defeat them, then I'll consider fighting you,"" Bai continued.

Shen, the swordsman, responded with an arrogant smile. ""Fine. A little warm-up will do me good before the real fight."" With that, he launched his attack without giving the party any chance to protest."
1834453785546752,WORLDEVENT82_PAGE1,"The adventurers had managed to defeat the swordsman, leaving him on his knees, shocked and defeated.

""Impossible... How could I lose?"" Shen muttered in disbelief.

Bai, meanwhile, appeared proud of the adventurers' victory. ""Of course, you'd lose. I'm one of their trainers, after all."" She started laughing, clearly amused by the turn of events. ""Now, you better let us go, or I'll have them beat you up some more."""
1834453785546753,WORLDEVENT82RESULT0_PAGE1,"""Fine... I'll let you go,"" Shen conceded.

""However, I will come with you!"" He said enthusiastically, bouncing back on his feet as if the recent fight had never happened.

""What?!"" Bai exclaimed, clearly caught off guard by this turn of events.

""Did you really think I'd give up so easily, my dear?"" Shen asked theatrically. ""I may have lost the battle, but not the war.""
""Ughh..."" Bai seemed less than thrilled about Shen wanting to tag along. Sensing her dissatisfaction, Shen added a final offer, ""If you let me come, I'll let you see Yu."" Hearing this, Bai's expression changed visibly.

""You're not messing with me, are you?"" She asked skeptically.

""You have my word,"" Shen replied. Despite her annoyance, Bai reluctantly agreed, saying, ""Fine. You can tag along, but keep your distance as long as you wear that ugly mask.""

The adventurers weren't entirely sure what had just happened, but it appeared that everything has been...resolved?"

Leaving the deceased woman abandoned in the snow without a proper burial felt wrong to each member of the group. She had already endured a harrowing journey far away from her home, and the least they could do for her was to lay her to rest with dignity.

They gathered what materials they could find to fashion a makeshift grave and gently lowered the woman into her final resting place. As they stood around the grave, they offered a prayer for the departed soul. During the prayer, the Guild Master noticed a faint whisper from the Divine Messenger's direction. Her words were almost imperceptible but carried a profound weight: ""Forgive me,...""

It was their unwavering devotion to the seven godsâ€”an esteemed practice that in stark contrast with our present times, waned in the later period of the ancient empire's era.

So profound was their faith that they even etched their unique rendition of the creation narrative within the hallowed walls of their ancestral abode.

""The Herathia family remains a mystery to me. Despite their noble heritage, serving the emperor's lineage since the empire's inception and receiving commendations for unwavering loyalty to the throne, it perplexes me that they have not held the highest echelon of influence. Instead, they have been overshadowed by two markedly younger families.

Upon delving further into their history, I have uncovered a rather astonishing truth. It appears that the Herathia family intentionally engineered their current position. There are abundant pieces of evidence suggesting that they deliberately bolstered the standing of the other families, even at the expense of their own status and power. This revelation has led me to question the underlying motives behind their actions.

My current conjecture is that the Herathia family sought to create a perceptible distance between themselves and the emperor's inner circle. In doing so, they seem to have aimed for a position where they retain substantial influence while evading the Emperor's direct attention. Such is their affinity for this third position that they have incorporated the number into their very identity. Their family crest features the ancient symbol of three, and the inscription 'The Third of Everything' adorns it.""

In contrast, Emily seemed excited as meeting the Elder was her remaining best lead to the Flower of Eternity.

Gathering in the middle ground, the Guild Master, Emily, and Hopi approached the Elder, with the adventurers positioned further back to emphasize peaceful intentions.

"
1834453940736001,WORLDEVENT143_PAGE3,"""Why you want to know, Elder asked."" Hopi translated back. Emily was visibly hopeful now, as it seemed that Elder knew something.

Miraculously, it seems that Emily's action actually put a stop to the fighting, as both the adventurers and the Lephoz were stopped in their tracks by the unexpected turn of events. The atmosphere remained tense, however, and both sides still eyed each other nervously. 
Then suddenly, the Elder shouted something, prompting the Lephoz warriors to drop their weapons. The adventurers, under the Guild Master's instruction, followed suit. In a sudden turn of events, the factions, previously locked in combat, agreed to a truce.

Hopi, who had chosen to stay out of the conflict, returned. The Elder shifted his attention to Emily, posing a question in his language.

""What is your name, girl?"" Hopi translated."

""Y-yes, that's my name,"" Emily answered, puzzled by the Elder's interest. He appeared deep in thought before uttering something. The translation Hopi provided was unexpected.

""I'll guide you to Flower of Eternity."""

""This is Flower of Eternity,"" Hopi translated the Elder's words.

A sudden realization washed over Emily and her face turned pale.

The creature, now identified as the Flower of Eternity, seemed to sense their presence despite her covered eyes. She called out, and the Elder rushed to her side, talking in a gentle tone they didn't know he was capable of.

Emily approached, and for a moment,  the Guild Master wondered if they should stop her. However, they could tell from Emily's expression that she wants to do this. As she drew near, the creature extended her remaining arm, touching Emily's face. After tracing her features, the Flower of Eternity then withdrew her hand.

"
1834453944930305,WORLDEVENT145_PAGE3,"""It's similar but not him,"" the creature noted, sounding slightly disappointed.

""Are you talking about my ancestor? Kayle Altem?"" Emily inquired.

A sad smile appeared on the creature's face. ""Ancestor, huh? Has it been so long already?"" she lamented. ""Then that means he's already gone,"" she added, falling silent.

""Are you the Flower of Eternity?"" Emily eventually asked, breaking the silence. Her face had a sorrowful look that accompanied her ever since they learned of the Flower of Eternity's form.

It was easy for the Guild Master to imagine what the creature might have endured, if even only a fraction of the legendary properties associated with the Flower of Eternity were true. It couldn't have been an easy life.

Tears suddenly started to fall from Emily's eyes.

""Why are you sad, child?"" the creature asked, somehow sensing Emily's sorrow.

""B-because *sob* it must have been so hard for you! I can't even imagine what you had to go through in your life!"" Emily responded through tears. The creature embraced Emily and smiled. ""You're just as kind as he was,"" she said and with this Emily's search for the Flower Of Eternity came to an unexpected end."

""This is only a small part of me and will eventually grow back. Even then, I know there is great potency in it,"" the creature explained. ""Please take this gift in place of your ancestor, who has done so much for me."" In the end she accepted the gift.

Before the adventurers stood the priest they had encountered so many times before. Suspicion crept into their minds as they began to wonder if he was actually following them.

""I wasn't sure what to think of you,"" the priest began, his tone thoughtful. ""No matter how absurd my requests seemed, you still extended a helping hand. Each time we met, it should have been obvious that you were being taken advantage of. And yet, despite it all, you continued to assist me. Was it because you are fools who are unaware of what happens around them?"" He smiled at them. ""Or is it because you understand the true essence of kindness?

Snow draped over your form, chilling your body. Your mind told you that you need to move to live. Yet, even in this numbed state, the will to survive dissolved into nothing. You allowed it to happen.

As the cold tightened its grip and your vision blurred, your final thoughts reached out to your family and those you held dear. Were they waiting in the afterlife? Would you reunite with them?

Rogue was visibly taken aback; it seemed like that remark had genuinely hurt her. ""I'm doing this for you! 'They' have found out where I am! Their killing party is sure to arrive here at any point now, and I have to lure them away from all of you!"" she explained furiously.

However, one of the adventurers interjected, suggesting that they had likely already encountered that killing party and successfully dealt with it. Rogue appeared a bit stupefied, as if someone had taken the wind out of her sails.

They called the others to gather around and explained that they had encountered similar stones in their past as an adventurer. These rune stones were of jotun origin and possessed magical properties, intended to aid and protect weary travelers on their journeys.


The Divine Messenger was slightly surprised to learn that jotuns were responsible for setting up the stone, as they were often associated with hostility and raiding. The Guild Master then clarified that not all jotun tribes held animosity toward outsiders.


The Guild Master started to offer a prayer to the rune, and the group could feel the magic of the stone enveloping them. A warm glow surrounded them, and a sense of protection and reassurance washed over the adventurers."

Their numbers were growing rapidly, and the adventurers knew that they had to disperse this gathering before the goblins' force reached a critical mass capable of devastating the surrounding lands.

The adventurers' arrival did not go unnoticed however, and the goblins began to close in on them.

One woman stood apart from the horde, clearly a disciple of the witch.

""How foolish of you to enter this place alone,"" she taunted. ""When we're through with you, we'll lay waste to the villages and towns in the vicinity and offer their souls to the demon lords.""

She pointed at the adventurers, ""Your souls will be the appetizer!"""

The Guild Master observed how the divine messenger appeared remarkably resilient, seemingly untouched by fatigue, while her bodyguard already struggled to keep up. They couldn't help but wonder if her endurance was also due to the blessing of the gods.

Recognizing the growing fatigue among the adventurers, the Guild Master suggested taking a brief rest before continuing. The divine messenger, however, was against the suggestion. She argued that stopping might cause them to lose the trails of the jotuns and their captives."

Before long, their fears were confirmedâ€”a fierce snowstorm began to sweep through the area. The wind howled, biting through their clothes, and the temperature plummeted to bone-chilling levels, causing even those with thick garments to shiver uncontrollably.

Caught in the midst of this storm, the group were faced with an important decision: press on despite the harsh conditions or seek shelter and wait for the tempest to subside.

The Divine Messenger, however, looked like she was determined to continue marching."

They sought refuge in a nearby cave, huddling together for warmth as the snowstorm raged outside. The Guild Master noticed how the bodyguard bowed their head, seemingly offering a silent prayer, likely praying for the safety of the captives. In contrast, the Divine Messenger only gazed at the snowstorm in contemplative silence. The Guild Master wondered if someone who had direct connections with the gods has a different view on praying."

The cold wind whipped through them like a cruel adversary, affecting them not only physically but also mentally. The biting chill seemed to penetrate their very souls, testing the limits of their endurance. Frostbite threatened some of the adventurers, yet despite the hardships and suffering, they pressed forward.

The sounds of axes against trees echoed through the air as the invaders began chopping down the surrounding forest to procure materials for their siege equipment.

Through the spyglass, the Guild Master could see wooden ladders under construction. It was evident, that the enemy intended to assault the walls sooner than later.

Even more worrisome, however, was the realization that the enemy was also working on catapults. The knowledge that bombardment might soon commence filled the Guild Master with a silent dread. Yet, the Guild Master knew that, for now, there was little they could do to prevent the enemy's preparations. The defenders were left with no choice but to watch and wait, hoping for any signs or hints that might aid them in surviving the siege.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting shadows over the besieged fortress, the first day of the siege concluded without any direct confrontation. The night settled in, and the Guild Master left the rest of the observation to one of the adventurers while retiring to their bed. However, it proved to be a very sleepless night.
"
1834454242725888,WORLDEVENT259_PAGE2,"On the second day of the siege, the routine of the enemy army remained unchanged. Their focus still remained on the construction of their siege equipments, and once again, there was no direct assault on the fortress.

However, a small commotion occurred when it was discovered that Me'can, the merchant had mysteriously disappeared. The news circulated among the defenders, giving rise to whispers and speculation. The sudden vanishing act fueled rumors among the adventurers, that there might be a hidden tunnel within the Guild. However, as much they tried to find one, there was none to be found.

The Guild Master, accustomed to Me'can's mysterious nature, didn't dwell too much on the merchant's disappearance.  Me'can has always been an enigmatic figure. For him to be able to just leave a besieged fortress on a whim, did not surprise the Guild Master. Instead the Guild Master maintained their vigilance over the enemy's activities. The construction of siege equipment progressed at an alarming rate. The wooden ladders were nearing completion, and the catapults were also close to being finished. It was a disheartening sight, with the only upside being that the second day also ended peacefully. 

However, that would not last long.

1834454242725889,WORLDEVENT259RESULT0_PAGE1,"The tranquility of the siege ended on the third day as violent screams echoed through the Guild. The Guild Master rushed to the walls to witness a horrifying sight. The enemy had commenced their bombardment, hurling massive boulders into the heart of the fortress. The boulders soared above the walls, descending upon the defenders with destructive force. The enemy's strategy became clear; they weren't targeting the walls but instead sought to inflict casualties among the defenders. It seemed the attackers had deemed a direct assault on the walls too time-consuming and opted for a tactic that aimed to weaken the defenders before a potential assault.

Chaos erupted within the Guild as adventurers scrambled for cover, seeking refuge from the deadly hail of boulders. The air filled with the deafening crashes of boulders colliding with the Guild's structures, mixed with the screams of the unfortunate souls caught in the open, buried beneath one of the colossal stones. 

How long could they last this?"
1834454242725890,WORLDEVENT260_PAGE1,"On the fifth day, an eerie calm settled over the fortress. The enemy, instead of launching another assault, seemed content to simply maintain their siege and leave the defenders alone. The Guild Master couldn't shake a nagging sense of unease over the sudden change of tactics.

Throughout the day, the defenders remained vigilant, their eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of movement. Tensions lingered, and the fortress was enveloped in an atmosphere of cautious anticipation. However, as the sun dipped below the skyline, the day concluded without any incidents."

The Guild Master, responding immediately to the report, arrived at the scene only to find the store completely destroyed. Nothing was left.

The Guild Master's mind raced with questions. Was this the work of the enemy, and was it the reason they decided to take their time? If so, how did they know where the supplies were gathered, and how did they get in? Despite the numerous questions, the Guild Master had no answers, but there was no time to dwell on uncertainties anyway.
"

At the end of the day, no intruders could be found, and the gathered food supply was woefully insufficient to sustain the besieged adventurers for more than a few days, even with the strictest rationing. 

Days seven to nine were peaceful, but the fortress remained on edge.  The lack of food weighed heavily on the morale of the adventurers, and it didn't improve with the threat of an still unknown intruder amongst their midst. The only thing they could do was to double the guards at the gate to prevent any possible attempt to open it from within. However, as the Guild Master's stomach rumbled, they wondered how much longer they could last."

Something was amiss, and the Guild Master couldn't quite put their finger on it. Something smelled wrong...or rather good?

Greeting them with a playful tone, Me'can exclaimed, ""What a shame. You all woke up earlier than I expected. I wanted to surprise you with breakfast, just like my mother used to cook for me.""

With Me'can's return came crates filled with food, a welcome sight for the hungry and fatigued adventurers.  This was such a welcoming sight to the Guild Master that they didn't dare to question how Me'can managed to enter the Guild or, how he managed to carry all the supplies inside or how he even knew that they were starving. None of it mattered.

Adventurers eagerly assisted Me'can in preparing the meals, and soon, everyone enjoyed their first proper meal in days.

Without skipping a beat he said: ""I poisoned the food, Guild Master.""

The courtyard fell silent as Me'can's unexpected revelation echoed through the air. Adventurers halted their eating, their expressions shifting to horror as they processed the shocking statement. The atmosphere hung heavy with tension until, to everyone's surprise, both the Guild Master and Me'can began to laugh.

""I see you finally get my humor!"" Me'can declared mischieviously. The initial shock gave way to a wave of relieved laughter as others joined in, breaking the tension. Finally, laughter has returned to the Guild."

The giant bird loomed before them, its magnificent yet menacing form exuding the power of lightning. Electricity crackled and danced around its body, every swing of its wings sending forth gusts of pressure that threatened to knock them off their feet.

As the Storm Talon's piercing gaze locked onto the intruders, it recognized the threat they posed. With a mighty beat of its wings, the avian behemoth ascended into the turbulent sky. A deafening shriek pierced the air, a primal call of challenge that echoed across the mountaintop. The storm intensified, becoming even more relentless as lightning arced dangerously close to the adventurers.

Blood adorned the hall, mingling with the remains of cultists strewn about. At the heart of the chamber stood a figure the Guild Master immediately recognized: The Emperor.

Before the Emperor loomed a massive, magical orb containing what seems to be a towering womanâ€”the sealed goddess they sought to free.

""It appears you've managed to find my resting place,"" the Emperor remarked, his voice tinged with malice. ""But alas, you're too late. I have returned to this world as you can see.""
"
1834454276280321,WORLDEVENT280_PAGE2,"""How?!"" cried the Divine Messenger in confusion. ""The gods were certain you had not yet amassed enough souls. How, then..."" Her gaze swept over the lifeless forms of the cultists.

""It's precisely as you think, child,"" the Emperor retorted coldly. ""My followers sacrificed themselves for my sake. So that I could return and lead the world."" The Guild Master observed the corpses, noting signs of resistance among some. It was clear that some were clearly not as willing as he claimed.

""It doesn't matter,"" the Guild Master declared. ""You are just one man. We will just put you back in your coffin and free the goddess.""
"
1834454276280322,WORLDEVENT280RESULT0_PAGE1,"""Just one man?"" the Emperor scoffed. ""I AM THE EMPEROR!""

A gust of wind heralded his proclamation. ""I AM THE SOVEREIGN RULER OF THESE REALMS, AND EVEN THE BEASTS BOW BEFORE ME!"" From the shadows, a horde of monsters materialized, positioning themselves between the adventurers and the Emperor.

""MY LEGIONS HAVE CONQUERED NATIONS AND REMAIN BOUND TO MY WILL, EVEN IN DEATH!"" Ancient corpses stirred, raising their arms in allegiance once more.
"
1834454276280323,WORLDEVENT280RESULT0_PAGE2,"The Emperor pointed at the adventurers. ""You have but two options: kneel or perish!""

The Guild Master looked at the adventurers and without exchanging a single word each of them simply gave the Guild Master a determined smile. 

""You have chosen poorly, adventurers,"" the Emperor declared coldly.

The Guild Master led the Divine Messenger and her Guard to a safe distance. In this fight they would be nothing more than a burden.
And so, the final confrontation against the Emperor was about to start."
1834454276280324,WORLDEVENT281_PAGE1,"The Battle has become a foregone conclusion and yet the Emperor refused to yield. Covered in wounds, he still kept swinging his sword, fighting alone with every ally already dead.

However, in the end, the Emperor's shattered body betrayed him, and he collapsed, his sword slipping from his grasp. Desperately, he reached for his weapon, crying out,

""THIS CANNOT BE THE END! 
WHAT WAS IT ALL FOR? 
EVERY SACRIFICE I MADE! EVERY LIFE I TOOK! 

IT CANNOT BE ALL FOR NAUGHT!""""

His shouts echoed the hall, as he continued his futile attempts to reclaim his sword...until, at last, he fell silent.

The Guild Master could see that the Emperor was still alive and approached him with a drawn dagger. When the Guild Master stood above the Emperor, the Emperor didn't seem to even notice. The Guild Master noticed a vacant expression in his eyes and recognized the look of a man who has abandoned all hope. A man too tired to even despair.

Without hesitation, the Guild Master drove the dagger into the Emperor's heart. As the Emperor drew his final breath, a whisper escaped his lips,

""...Amadia...""


With the Emperor's death there was only one thing left to do.

Despite causing numerous casualties, the enemy managed to place several ladders at different points on the wall. The adversaries finally initiated their attack on the walls, but they were met with fierce resistance from the defending adventurers. Instructors took charge of groups, contributing to the defense.

Fortunately, the Guild was once an ancient military fortress, strategically positioned in a nearly impregnable location. Seeing that the enemy lacked any form of siege equipment, the Guild Master was confident that, even with the limited number of adventurers, they could withstand the assault for a considerable time. However, they had to ask themself: For how long?"

Before him lay a young man, broken and helpless. Vorathax watched the young man writhes on the ground with broken legs, like it was some kind of sick form of entertainment to take pleasure in.

"
1834454431469568,WORLDEVENT339_PAGE2,"As Vorathax turned his gaze upon the adventurers, his voice thundered in their minds. ""More mice have arrived,"" he mused, without even really acknowledging them. ""Have they come to save their little mouse friend? Or are they just confused rats charging into death?"" Vorathax's words were  laced with sadistic amusement. ""Perhaps ending their lives will prove more entertaining than watching this pathetic creature's futile struggle for life,"" he continued, his words directed more at himself than the adventurers. Human beings were not creatures to converse with; they were merely playthings, disposable toys for his personal amusement.

With a sadistic grin, Vorathax rose to his feet, towering over them with his massive body. Without waiting for a reply, he prepared to unleash his wrath upon them, relishing the thought of the impending carnage.

Vorathax The Terror has started his attack."
1834454431469569,WORLDEVENT340_PAGE1,"It was a miracle....The adventurers had slain Vorathax The Terror. The Scourge of Mankind, The Harbinger of Death and Destruction, The Destroyer of Worlds and many more; all the titles and epithets that once instilled fear in the hearts of all who heard them now served only as testament to their triumph over the mighty beast. It was a feat that would echo through the annals of history as one of the greatest achievements of their time. 

However, before the adventurers could celebrate and let it all go to their heads, they remembered the young man lying on the ground, barely clinging to life. They rushed to his side, tending to his wounds immediately as best as they could. As they tended to him, they asked if he knew of a man named ""Zephyrion"".

""T-that's me,"" he replied, his voice barely above a whisper as he summoned the last ounce of his strength. With those words, he fell unconscious, his body finally succumbing to the exhaustion and pain that the whole ordeal has brought to him."
1834454431469570,WORLDEVENT341_PAGE1,"As the adventurers and the Guild Master entered the room, they found themselves surrounded by a large group of all too familiar enemies. Goblins, Lephoz, Jotuns, Vampires, Cultists; individuals from various races and regions had united under a common banner, devoted to serving the demon lords.  Among this assembly of dark forces, their leader, the chosen of the demon lords, the Witch, stood prominently.

""I suppose it was inevitable that you would discover my sanctuary, Guild Master,"" the witch remarked with a hint of sardonic humor. ""I offered you a different path, an alternative to the conflict we now find ourselves embroiled in. You could have continued to lead your little Guild, hunting monsters and brigands, and left us to our pursuits. Yet, you chose differently."""
1834454431469571,WORLDEVENT341_PAGE2,"""Instead, you followed orders which you do not understand yourself. Do you truly believe the gods have dispatched you to confront me solely to safeguard a few human souls?"" A brief silence hung in the room, thick with tension. ""I guess it doesn't matter. All that matters is that you have chosen to oppose us."" the witch declared, as an aura of darkness enveloped her and malevolent crimson light emanated from the eye sockets of her bone mask.

""Let us bring this conflict to a close, Guild Master. You and your Adventurer Guild shall never stand in my way again!"""
1834454435663872,WORLDEVENT342_PAGE1,"It was over.

The defeated Witch knelt before the adventurers and the Guild Master, her fate completely in their hands. Despite her defeat her gaze met theirs, unyielding, refusing to beg or seek mercy.

The Guild Master understood what has to be done and asked one of the adventurers to do the deed. A blade was drawn and as the adventurer was about to strike the witch a booming voice stopped them.

""Do not harm her!""
"
1834454435663873,WORLDEVENT342RESULT0_PAGE1,"The Guild Master turned to see that the Divine Messenger and her bodyguard had arrived. Relief washed over the Guild Master briefly, knowing the Divine Messenger was safe. However, that relief was swiftly replaced by unease, when they realized that there was something off about the Divine Messenger. Her eyes shimmered with an ethereal light, and her voice carried an otherworldly resonance.

It didn't take long until they understood the situation. The gods had taken over her.

The Divine Messenger moved past the adventurers, who stood frozen in awe and confusion, unsure how to comport themselves before the embodiment of divinity. But the possessed Divine Messenger paid them no heed, focusing her attention on the Witch, who returned her gaze with a fierce, unyielding hatred.

""Where is the emperor's body?"" The divine voice resonated in an otherworldly tone, directed at the Witch. She didn't answer."
1834454435663874,WORLDEVENT342RESULT0_PAGE2,"The Divine Messenger raised her hand, casting a blinding light upon the Witch, who writhed in agony as if submerged in scalding water. Once the torment ceased, the question was repeated, and yet the Witch remained silent. The process was repeated time and again, and each time, the Witch's cries pierced the chamber. The adventurers watched in horror as a person was being subjected to torture before their eyes.

Finally the Guild Master stepped in and held the divine Messenger back.
""That's enough."" The Guild Master said with slight unease. ""She is already unconscious."" The Witch lay sprawled on the ground, seemingly lifeless, except for the subtle rise and fall of her chest indicating that she still drew breath.


"
1834454435663875,WORLDEVENT342RESULT0_PAGE3,"The Divine Messenger's gaze turned toward the Guild Master. The divine presence lacked any trace of empathy, and for an instant, the Guild Master felt an instinctual fear, their hand moving toward their weapon. However, the Divine Messenger relented.

""Bring her back to the Guild. There is a dungeon in your fortress where we can continue the questioning when she regains consciousness,"" the divine voice commanded, leaving no room for negotiation.

""Alright,"" the Guild Master responded, still one hand on their weapon. ""But first, allow the Divine Messenger to regain control of her body. We will take it from here."" The request hung heavily in the air, leaving all present uncertain as to whether the divine entity would abide. However, the glowing eyes of the Divine Messenger finally dimmed, and she sank to her knees.

"
1834454435663876,WORLDEVENT342RESULT0_PAGE4,"The Divine Messenger gasped for air as if she has been drowning. Her whole body trembled as she clutched her arms as if she feared being separated from her body once more.
Then something unexpected happened...the Divine Messenger started to cry. 

Tears streamed down her cheeks as she wept.

Her sobbing was the only sound that echoed the chamber
"
1834454439858176,WORLDEVENT343_PAGE1,"The adventurers stumbled upon a desk cluttered with scattered papers, notes, and maps. Upon closer inspection, it became evident that these documents were written by the witch herself."

Describing plans that were in the making or have already been completed. What caught their attention was the fact that many of the operations were associated with estimated numbers and everytime one of the operations seems to be completed another number got reduced by it. After looking through all the plans they realized that the operations' goal was to reduce a certain number, for what reason they did not know. But the lowest the number has gotten seems to indicate that the cult wouldn't need much longer to reduce it to zero.

Continuing to go through the papers the adventurers found two more things of note. A notebook and a group of paper what seems to be the copy of a contract littered with notes."

Although the text remained intentionally convoluted, after a more meticulous read, {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} realized that it had been carefully crafted to eliminate any legal loopholes for either party. Extensive notes and comments, presumably added by the witch, seemed designed to fortify the contract, ensuring that it left the demon lords with only the intended interpretation.
 
And it didn't take long for {CHARACTER1} to grasp the essence of the deal.

It was an exchange.

It promised an astronomical quantity of souls to the demon lords in return for the rebirth of a single soul held in their possession, ambiguously referred to as the ""main contract holder."" Intriguingly, an addendum restricted the demon lords' influence over the witch. Although laden with complex conditions, the addendum essentially prevented the demon lords from monitoring the witch's actions.

A question began to gnaw at {CHARACTER1}'s mind: Did the witch have secrets she withheld even from her patrons, the demon lords?
