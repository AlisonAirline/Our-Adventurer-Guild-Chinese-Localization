Among them stood one captive, forced onto a red circle by the cultists, who bore an uncanny resemblance to the Divine Messenger. A worrisome thought appeared in the Guild Master's mind as they observed the captive's appearance and clothing.

Recognition flashed across the eyes of one of the cultists as he saw the Divine Messenger. ""That's the real one!"" he exclaimed, pointing at her. ""Get her! My masters will reward you greatly if you capture her!"" he barked towards the jotuns, who responded with malicious grins.

公会会长心中有些疑问，但显然现在不是提问的时候。“准备好，冒险者们！”他们在巨人逼近时大喊。

准备战斗！"

The other captives too expressed their gratitude and their voices echoed in the air. The Divine Messenger smiled and offered comfort to the captives, showing them the compassion that had earned her their trust and devotion. However, the Guild Master noticed a faint unease in her smile.

The Guild Master started to observe the aftermath of the battle. It was a bloody battle and all the jotuns and as well the cultists were killed. Or so they thought until they saw a faint movement amongst the bodies. To their surprise, one of the cultists still clung to life, trying to crawl away in a desperate bid for survival.

公会会长开始观察战斗的后果。这是一场血腥的战斗，所有的巨人和邪教徒都被杀死了。或者说，他们原以为是这样，直到他们看到尸体中微弱的动静。令他们惊讶的是，一名邪教徒仍然顽强地活着，试图在绝望中爬走以求生存。"

Preparations were made to leave, but as the captives praised the Divine Messenger, the Guild Master couldn't help but question whether these people would still offer their adoration if they knew that they just had been used...as bait.",136,"一名冒险者上前准备了结这名邪教徒，但神圣使者的保镖站在了中间。“不是他。”神圣使者说道。保镖随即将邪教徒击晕，并将昏迷的身体扛在肩上。

“这真的是我们追捕他们的原因吗？”公会会长问道，声音中透着干涩。神圣使者没有回答，但她的沉默告诉他们一切。

准备离开时，囚犯们赞美神圣使者，但公会会长不禁质疑，如果这些人知道他们只是被利用……作为诱饵，他们是否还会继续崇拜她。"
