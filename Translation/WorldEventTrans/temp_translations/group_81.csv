""You have to let me go!"" Rogue insisted, attempting unsuccessfully to break free from Luana's grip.

""No! You can't just disappear like that!"" Luana protested, holding her back. ""I just found you again, and now you want to leave me behind again? Do I matter so little to you?""

Rogue was visibly taken aback; it seemed like that remark had genuinely hurt her. ""I'm doing this for you! 'They' have found out where I am! Their killing party is sure to arrive here at any point now, and I have to lure them away from all of you!"" she explained furiously.

However, one of the adventurers interjected, suggesting that they had likely already encountered that killing party and successfully dealt with it. Rogue appeared a bit stupefied, as if someone had taken the wind out of her sails.

",252,"冒险者们终于找到了Rogue和Luana。后者正拉着前者，不让她逃跑。

“你必须让我走！”Rogue坚持道，试图挣脱Luana的束缚，但未能成功。

“不要！你不能就这样消失！”Luana抗议道，紧紧抓住她。“我刚找到你，而你现在又想抛下我？我对你来说就这么不重要吗？”

Rogue显然感到震惊；这句话似乎真的伤到了她。“我这样做是为了你！‘他们’已经发现我在哪里了！他们的杀戮小队随时可能到达这里，我必须把他们引开！”她愤怒地解释道。

然而，一名冒险者插话，建议他们可能已经遇到过那个杀戮小队并成功处理了它。Rogue显得有些愣住，仿佛有人把她的气势彻底打败了。"
1834454230142976,WORLDEVENT252RESULT0_PAGE1,"""W-was it really them? Was there a certain woman amongst them?""

She bombarded the party with questions, and after receiving her answers, she seemed lost in thought.

""Maybe... if not even they were able to... No! I can't. It's too..."" Before Rogue could finish her sentence, Luana looked at her with a pleading expression.

""Please! Just come back with me. Whatever happens, we can help you. I will help you,"" Luana said.

Rogue seemed to internally wrestle with her decision, but in the end, she relented. ""I... I'm going back. I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused."" Luana smiled and hugged her.

""N-Not in front of the adventurers!""

Rogue's embarrassment made the party chuckle, and together, they embarked on their journey back home to the Adventurer Guild.",252,"“真的就是他们吗？其中有某个女人吗？”

她向队伍发起了一连串的问题，在得到答案后，她似乎陷入了沉思。

“也许……如果连他们都没有能力……不！我不能。太……”在Rogue还没说完时，Luana用恳求的眼神看着她。

“请！跟我回去吧。不管发生什么，我们都能帮你。我会帮你的，”Luana说道。

Rogue似乎在内心挣扎着做出决定，但最终她妥协了。“我……我回去。我为我造成的麻烦感到抱歉。”Luana微笑着拥抱了她。

“在冒险者面前可不行！”

Rogue的尴尬让队伍忍不住笑了起来，大家一起踏上了回家前往冒险者公会的旅程。"
1834454230142977,WORLDEVENT253_PAGE1,"As the group stumbled upon a lonely rune stone during their travels, the Guild Master immediately recognized it. They called the others to gather around and explained that they had encountered similar stones in their past as an adventurer. These rune stones were of jotun origin and possessed magical properties, intended to aid and protect weary travelers on their journeys.


The Divine Messenger was slightly surprised to learn that jotuns were responsible for setting up the stone, as they were often associated with hostility and raiding. The Guild Master then clarified that not all jotun tribes held animosity toward outsiders.


The Guild Master started to offer a prayer to the rune, and the group could feel the magic of the stone enveloping them. A warm glow surrounded them, and a sense of protection and reassurance washed over the adventurers.",253,"当队伍在旅行中偶然发现一块孤独的符文石时，公会会长立刻认出了它。他们叫其他人围过来，解释说他们在过去作为冒险者时也遇到过类似的石头。这些符文石源于巨人，具有魔法属性，旨在帮助和保护疲惫的旅行者。

神圣使者略感惊讶，得知这些符文石是巨人所设立，因为他们通常与敌意和掠夺相关。公会会长随后澄清，并非所有巨人部落都对外来者怀有敌意。

公会会长开始对符文祈祷，队伍能感受到石头的魔法包围着他们。温暖的光辉环绕着他们，保护和安慰的感觉涌向了冒险者们。"
1834454230142978,WORLDEVENT254_PAGE1,"In front of the adventurers, a horde of goblins, hobgoblins, and cultists had assembled. Their numbers were growing rapidly, and the adventurers knew that they had to disperse this gathering before the goblins' force reached a critical mass capable of devastating the surrounding lands.

The adventurers' arrival did not go unnoticed however, and the goblins began to close in on them.

One woman stood apart from the horde, clearly a disciple of the witch.

""How foolish of you to enter this place alone,"" she taunted. ""When we're through with you, we'll lay waste to the villages and towns in the vicinity and offer their souls to the demon lords.""

She pointed at the adventurers, ""Your souls will be the appetizer!""",254,"在冒险者面前，一群哥布林、半哥布林和邪教徒聚集在一起。他们的人数迅速增加，冒险者们知道必须在哥布林的力量达到能够摧毁周围土地的临界点之前，驱散这个聚集。

然而，冒险者的到来并没有被忽视，哥布林们开始向他们靠拢。

一名女性从人群中站出来，显然是女巫的弟子。

“你们单独进入这个地方真是太愚蠢了，”她嘲讽道。“等我们处理完你们后，我们将摧毁附近的村庄和城镇，并将他们的灵魂献给恶魔领主。”

她指着冒险者们，“你们的灵魂将是开胃菜！”"
