The Master of the Arena redirected his attention to the contestants and began to explain the rules of the forthcoming challenge.

""The next challenge will test your willpower,"" he announced. ""Don't be deceived by the plate's harmless appearance. It conceals a powerful illusion spell, making it feel as though you're standing on unimaginably hot coals. How long can you endure the searing sensation before finally yielding?""
",22,"在射箭场被拆除后，一块巨大的金属板被带入竞技场中央。一名看似是巫师的男子走上前，向金属板施下了一个法术。  

竞技场的主持人将注意力转向参赛者，开始解释即将到来的挑战规则。  

“下一个挑战将考验你们的意志力，”他宣布道。“不要被金属板无害的外表所欺骗。它隐藏着一个强大的幻觉法术，让你感觉仿佛站在难以想象的炽热煤炭上。你能忍受这种灼热的感觉多久，才会最终屈服？”"
1834453655523334,WORLDEVENT22_PAGE2,"One by one, contestants took their turns standing on the searing plate. Some couldn't endure even a second, leaping away in agony as soon their feet touched the plate. Others managed to withstand the intense discomfort a bit longer, but the difference amounted to mere seconds.

Then, a man from Falken's former party stepped onto the plate and remained resolute.

Ten seconds passed...
Twenty seconds passed...

As the moments ticked by, contestants who had previously experienced the torment of the plate stared in disbelief. They knew firsthand just how excruciating it was to endure, and they could scarcely fathom how anyone could withstand it for so long.",22,"参赛者们一个接一个地站上了炽热的金属板。有些人甚至连一秒钟都无法忍受，脚一接触到金属板就痛苦地跳开。其他人则稍微坚持得久一点，但差别也不过是几秒钟。  

然后，来自法肯前队伍的一名男子走上了金属板，坚定不移地站在那里。  

十秒过去了……  
二十秒过去了……  

随着时间的推移，之前经历过金属板折磨的参赛者们目瞪口呆。他们亲身知道忍受这种痛苦是多么的折磨，几乎无法想象有人能坚持这么久。"
1834453659717632,WORLDEVENT22_PAGE3,"A full minute passed before the man finally descended from the plate, not in agony like the earlier contestants, but calmly and collected. He was welcomed with open arms by his comrades, drenched in sweat from the intense ordeal. The other contestants who had attempted the challenge before began to applaud, showing their deep respect for the man's exceptional resolve.

Now, it was time for the adventurers' turn to face this daunting test of willpower.",22,"一整分钟过去了，这名男子才从金属板上下来，并没有像之前的参赛者那样痛苦，而是冷静而从容。他的同伴们热情地欢迎他，尽管他因激烈的考验而满身是汗。之前尝试过挑战的其他参赛者们开始鼓掌，表达对这名男子非凡毅力的深深敬意。  

现在，冒险者们也该面对这个艰巨的意志力考验了。"

Finally, {CHARACTER1} realized that {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} could endure no longer and slowly descended from the plate, squeezing as many seconds as possible into the final result.
