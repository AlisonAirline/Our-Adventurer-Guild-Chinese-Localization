The giant bird loomed before them, its magnificent yet menacing form exuding the power of lightning. Electricity crackled and danced around its body, every swing of its wings sending forth gusts of pressure that threatened to knock them off their feet.

As the Storm Talon's piercing gaze locked onto the intruders, it recognized the threat they posed. With a mighty beat of its wings, the avian behemoth ascended into the turbulent sky. A deafening shriek pierced the air, a primal call of challenge that echoed across the mountaintop. The storm intensified, becoming even more relentless as lightning arced dangerously close to the adventurers.
",274,"冒险者们终于到达了山顶，与风暴之爪面对面。

这只巨鸟在他们面前高耸，华丽而又威胁的形态散发着雷电的力量。电流在它的身体周围闪烁舞动，每一次挥动翅膀都带来强烈的气流，仿佛要将他们击倒。

当风暴之爪锐利的目光锁定在入侵者身上时，它意识到了他们所构成的威胁。随着一声巨响，它强有力地扇动翅膀，飞向动荡的天空。刺耳的尖啸划破空气，发出一种原始的挑战召唤，回荡在山顶之上。风暴愈发猛烈，闪电危险地逼近冒险者们。"

The Storm Talon dived towards the adventurers and the adventurers responded by charging towards it.

The battle has finally begun!",274,"面对这猛烈的表现，冒险者们坚定不移。

风暴之爪朝冒险者们俯冲而下，冒险者们则冲向它。

战斗终于开始了！"
1834454267891716,WORLDEVENT275_PAGE1,"The adventurers have won the battle and the Storm Talon lay defeated at their feet. With its death, the storm clouds started to dissipate and the warm rays of the sun cast a golden hue over the the once-turbulent landscape. The adventurers fell to their knees and breathed a sigh of relief. The arduous task of slaying the monster was finally over and they could finally relax.

However, that moment of serenity only lasted for a moment until they remembered that they still had to climb down the mountain to get back home. They started to scream in frustration.",275,"冒险者们赢得了战斗，风暴之爪在他们的脚下败倒。随着它的死亡，暴风云开始消散，温暖的阳光洒下金色的光辉，照耀着曾经动荡的景观。冒险者们跪倒在地，松了一口气。杀死这个怪物的艰巨任务终于结束，他们终于可以放松了。

然而，这片宁静的时刻只持续了一瞬，直到他们想起还得下山回家。他们开始沮丧地尖叫。"
1834454267891717,WORLDEVENT276_PAGE1,"The adventurers arrived at the hallway and saw the undead soldiers standing in formation just like the scholars described to them. In front of those undead soldiers stood a single undead warrior towering over all of them. It has lost one of its' arms but that did nothing to reduce the intimitading aura surrounding him. It was actually relieving for the adventurers to have such an advantage.

The undead soldiers stood at their positions and didn't move an inch. It was like they were saying that as long as the adventurers didn't come closer, they would have no quarrels with them.",276,"冒险者们来到走廊，看到了像学者描述的那样整齐站立的亡灵士兵。在那些亡灵士兵面前，站着一名高大的亡灵战士，俯视着他们。它失去了一只手臂，但这并没有减少它周围的威慑气息。对于冒险者们来说，拥有这样的优势实际上是令人宽慰的。

亡灵士兵们站在各自的位置上，一动不动。就像在说，只要冒险者们不靠近，他们就不会与之发生冲突。"

He swung his giant glaive after the adventurers who attempted to dodge. Those who hadn't dodged it, received a nasty wound.

After dealing the first strike, the warrior jumped back to the other soldiers who locked their shields together and marched towards the adventurers with their spears raised.",276,"当其中一人向亡灵迈出第一步时，站在前面的战士立刻以冒险者们意想不到的速度冲了上来；更何况它还是个亡灵。

它挥动着巨大的长柄斧，朝试图躲避的冒险者们袭来。那些没有躲开的，受到了严重的伤害。

在完成第一次攻击后，战士跳回到其他士兵身旁，他们将盾牌紧紧锁在一起，举起长矛朝冒险者们进发。"
