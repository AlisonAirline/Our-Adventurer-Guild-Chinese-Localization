It seems like the goblins tried their best to keep the troll in a good mood so they themselves won't end up in its belly. If the party were to attack now they would have to deal with all of them.

It wouldn't be an easy fight.",265,"队伍发现了巨魔。它被一群四处奔跑的小鬼包围着，小鬼们在为它按摩脚部并给它送食物。看来小鬼们尽力让巨魔保持好心情，以免自己最终成为它的腹中餐。如果队伍现在发动攻击，他们将不得不应对所有的小鬼。

这将是一场不容易的战斗。"

1834454255308801,WORLDEVENT266_PAGE1,"The party finally met the troll. It was gigantic mass of muscles with zero ounces of fat. It wielded a gigantic wooden club, the size of which could easily smash a grown man into a bloody stain on the ground.

It looked at the adventurers and started to smirk. It growled and a large number of goblins started to pour from everywhere. They knew what their master wanted and were ready to deliver it to him. 
The battle against the troll and his goblins was about to begin.

Prepare for battle!",266,"队伍终于见到了巨魔。它是一个巨大的肌肉团，毫无脂肪。它挥舞着一根巨大的木棒，大小足以将一个成年男子打成地上的血迹。

它看着冒险者，开始露出得意的微笑。它低吼着，大量的小鬼从四面八方涌出。它们知道主人想要什么，并准备好将其送给他。  
与巨魔和它的小鬼们的战斗即将开始。

准备战斗！"
1834454255308802,WORLDEVENT267_PAGE1,"The party spotted the troll and it looked like he was in a very foul mood.

Judging by all the halfeaten goblin-corpses surrounding him, he also seemed to be in a very hungry mood. It seems like that by getting rid of his meal, the adventurers have involuntarily turned the goblins into his emergency snacks. Some luckier goblins who managed to escape that fate, were hiding behind some stone pillars, shaking in fear.",267,"队伍发现了巨魔，它看起来心情非常糟糕。

从周围那些半吃的鬼尸来看，它似乎也非常饥饿。看起来，冒险者通过摆脱它的食物，不自觉地将小鬼们变成了它的应急零食。一些幸运的小鬼成功逃脱了这个命运，躲在一些石柱后面，因恐惧而颤抖。"
