A little temporary curse would be worth risking that. After making sure that there wasn't any additional traps guarding the rubies, the Party took the rubies and put them them in their bags.
After they did so a chill wen't down their spines. They felt off and sluggish. It was apparent now that the curse was taking its effect. For now they could only hope that for the rest of the Quest they could deal with the curse.",233,"队伍决定不顾诅咒拿走红宝石。毕竟，看到那些宝石的大小，谁会不想要呢？一小段暂时的诅咒值得冒这个险。在确保没有额外的陷阱守护红宝石后，队伍将红宝石放进了他们的包里。  
这样做后，他们感到一阵寒意袭来。感觉有些不对劲，行动迟缓。现在显然诅咒开始发挥作用了。此时，他们只能希望在接下来的任务中能够应对这个诅咒。"

Strangely for some reason after they did so a chill wen't down their spines. They felt off and sluggish. Something was wrong but they couldn't tell what it was.
All they could hope for now that it would eventually wear off.",234,"队伍决定尽管{CHARACTER1}提到的潜在风险，还是要拿走红宝石。毕竟，看到那些宝石的大小，谁会不想要呢？在确保没有陷阱守护红宝石后，队伍将红宝石放进了他们的包里。

Sometimes the dead can become lucid for a very brief moment, where they lose their hatred for the living and remember their past life.
This one made a few gestures at the party, clearly trying to communicate something but unable to do so in an easy manner.",235,"队伍遇到了一只鬼魂，奇怪的是它并没有立即表现出敌意。他们之前听说过这种情况。  
有时，死者会在短暂的瞬间变得清醒，失去对生者的仇恨，回忆起他们的过去。

After saying out loud what {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} was thinking the ghost nodded heavily. It seemed like the ghost wanted them to go to that place.,235,{CHARACTER1}仔细观察了鬼魂，明白鬼魂试图给他们指引方向。{GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她}想起了他们来这里时经过的一座奇形怪状的雕像，似乎和鬼魂试图做的奇怪变形有些相似。在大声说出{GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她}的想法后，鬼魂重重地点了点头。看起来鬼魂希望他们去那个地方。

When they arrived the ghost was already gone. The only thing that was left was a single ring which the adventurers then took with them.",235,"队伍回到{CHARACTER1}描述的地方，开始四处寻找。在那里，他们发现了一具与他们遇到的鬼魂非常相似的尸体。从尸体的状态来看，显然这个人死得并不容易。
