A sense of horror lingered, suggesting something truly dreadful had occurred within. Amidst the unsettling scene, they sensed another presence in the room—a ghost standing in a corner, seemingly oblivious to the adventurers. Judging by his attire, it appeared that this ghost had once been a priest in his lifetime.
",306,冒险者们走进一个房间，发现这里比走廊更加血腥。恐怖的气息弥漫在空气中，暗示着这里发生过可怕的事情。在这不安的场景中，他们感受到房间里还有另一个存在——一个站在角落里的幽灵，似乎对冒险者们毫无察觉。根据他的穿着判断，这个幽灵在生前似乎曾是一名牧师。

As {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} words resonated through the room, the ghost turned his gaze towards {CHARACTER1}, his face still unmoved by the gesture. Then {CHARACTER1} spoke something profound—a promise for a better world. The ghost's visage softened, and a grateful expression crossed his spectral features. As the ghost slowly started to dissipate into the ether, he offered them words of blessings.

The last blessing he would ever give.",306,"靠近幽灵，{CHARACTER1}开始念诵最后的祷告，以安息亡者。当{GENDER1:cond:=1?他的|=0?她的}话语在房间中回荡时，幽灵将目光转向{CHARACTER1}，他的脸上对这一举动依然没有任何反应。然后{CHARACTER1}说出了一句深刻的话——对一个更美好世界的承诺。幽灵的面容 softened，感激的神情在他幽灵般的面孔上闪现。当幽灵缓缓开始消散于虚空时，他向他们献上了祝福的话语。

这是他所能给予的最后祝福。"

As {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} words resonated through the room, the ghost turned his gaze towards {CHARACTER1}, his face unmoved by the gesture. The despair was already completely ingrained in the ghosts mind and even the peace of the afterlife could not undo. As the ghost slowly dissipated into the ether, there was no gratefulness.

Only indifference.",306,"靠近幽灵，{CHARACTER1}开始念诵最后的祷告，以安息亡者。当{GENDER1:cond:=1?他的|=0?她的}话语在房间中回荡时，幽灵将目光转向{CHARACTER1}，他的脸上对这一举动依然没有任何反应。绝望已经完全根植于幽灵的心中，甚至连来世的安宁也无法改变这一点。当幽灵缓缓消散于虚空时，他没有表现出任何感激。

只有冷漠。"
1834454326611969,WORLDEVENT308_PAGE1,"The party did it! They managed to slay the troll!

It was a hard fought battle but in the end they prevailed and the beast laid dead at their feet. The remaining goblins who saw their former master die, immediately scattered off.
They wouldn't miss their troll master and they surely had no interest in messing with the adventurers who just slew him.
Seeing that the battle was over, the adventurers sighed in relief.

The quest was successfully completed.",308,"队伍成功了！他们终于击杀了巨魔！

这是一场艰苦的战斗，但最终他们胜利了，野兽倒在了他们的脚下。剩下的哥布林看到他们的前主人死去，立刻四散而逃。  
他们不会怀念他们的巨魔主人，当然也对刚刚杀了他的冒险者们没有任何兴趣。  
看到战斗结束，冒险者们松了一口气。

任务成功完成。"
1834454326611970,WORLDEVENT309_PAGE1,"As the party traveled, they spotted a lone jotun warrior marching through the snowy landscape. What caught their attention was that he carried nothing but his weapon. When he noticed the party, his demeanor seemed excited, and he hurried toward them.

The party prepared themselves, expecting an attack, but it became apparent that he had no hostile intentions. Instead, he approached them in an attempt to communicate. However, none of them were familiar with the Jotun language, leading to difficulty in understanding what the warrior was trying to convey.",309,"当队伍旅行时，他们发现一名孤独的巨人战士正在雪地中行进。吸引他们注意的是，他身上只携带着武器。当他注意到队伍时，他的神情似乎很兴奋，急匆匆地朝他们走来。

队伍做好了准备，期待着攻击，但很快显然他并没有敌意。相反，他试图与他们沟通。然而，他们都不熟悉巨人语言，导致理解战士意图的困难。"

1834454326611972,WORLDEVENT309_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE1,"With a lot of effort {CHARACTER1} was able to discern the warrior's intention. It seemed like the jotun before them was getting old and he is wandering in search for a warrior's death.

Apparently. he thought that the adventurers could provide him with the glorious demise he sought. After further elaboration, {CHARACTER1} could tell that a duel with a non-magic warrior was the preferable way for the jotun to perish but it seems the warrior wasn't too picky as long he could die in battle.",309,"经过一番努力，{CHARACTER1}终于能够辨别出战士的意图。看来眼前的巨人正在变老，他在寻找一场战士的死亡。

显然，他认为冒险者们可以给他提供他所渴望的光荣死亡。经过进一步的阐述，{CHARACTER1}可以判断出，与一名非魔法战士的决斗是巨人希望的死亡方式，但似乎战士并不挑剔，只要能在战斗中死去就好。"
1834454326611973,WORLDEVENT309_DECISION1ALTRESULT0_PAGE1,"It became evident to the warrior that the party was unable to comprehend his intentions, and perhaps due to this frustration, he abruptly swung his weapon dangerously close to the adventurers. The swing was not aimed to hurt anybody, but it was close enough that the adventurers had to retreat to avoid injury.

With his weapon raised, he pointed it directly at the adventurers, giving the impression that he was provoking them into a confrontation.",309,"战士意识到队伍无法理解他的意图，或许由于这种挫败感，他突然将武器挥向冒险者，距离他们非常近。这个挥动并不是为了伤害任何人，但足够近以至于冒险者们不得不后退以避免受伤。

他举起武器，直接指向冒险者，给人一种他在挑衅他们进行对抗的印象。"
