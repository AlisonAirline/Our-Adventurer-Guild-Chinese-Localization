The adventurers readied their weapons but the girl immediately started to yield.
 
""Wait! Please! I'm not here to fight! I don't even like fighting!"" the girl said in a nervous voice. 
She dropped on her knees and lowered her head so fast that it hit the ground rather violently.

Despite that she started to talk like there was no tomorrow.",56,"冒险者们在一个看似是强盗们睡觉的军营房间里发现了一个孤独的女孩。根据她的外貌，他们立刻意识到她是强盗中的一员。  

冒险者们准备好了武器，但女孩立刻开始投降。  

“等一下！请！我不是来打架的！我甚至不喜欢打架！”女孩用紧张的声音说道。  
她跪下，低下头的速度快得几乎撞到了地面。  

尽管如此，她开始说话，仿佛没有明天一样。"

And they're all dead now! I tried to quit but it never felt like the right time to say it. I never liked what we did but I have a hard time standing up to anyone. Even less when most of these people seem like they have very short fuses. I tried my best not to get involved in harming anybody but sometimes I had to take one of the prisoners to these creepy robed guys. Then they started to force these tattoos on some of us. I wanted to say no but have you seen those robed people? They're so damn scary! Oh, why did all of this happen? I wish I could just redo my life!""
",56,“我叫Misasa，我为成为强盗感到抱歉！我甚至不想成为强盗，但我的一些朋友逼我和他们一起加入强盗王。而他们现在都死了！我试图退出，但从来没有觉得是说出来的合适时机。我从来不喜欢我们所做的事情，但我很难对任何人站出来。更何况这些人看起来都脾气暴躁。我尽力不参与伤害任何人，但有时我不得不把一个囚犯带给那些可怕的披风人。然后他们开始强迫我们中的一些人纹身。我想拒绝，但你见过那些披风人吗？他们实在是太可怕了！哦，这一切为什么会发生？我希望我能重新过一次我的生活！”
1834453731020803,WORLDEVENT56_PAGE3,"The adventurers put their weapons away. It seems like she really had no intention of fighting.

She raised her head and looked pleadingly at the adventurers. Blood dripping from her forehead.

""Please! Let me go and I swear I will quit being a bandit for good."" She begged.",56,"冒险者们收起了武器。看来她真的没有打架的意图。  

她抬起头，恳求地看着冒险者们。血从她的额头流下。  

“请！放我走，我发誓我会永远不再做强盗。”她恳求道。"

Misasa thanked the party nervously and started to leave hesistantly. It seems like she didn't think that the adventurers would actually let her go. 

With her gone the party continued to search for the Bandit King.",56,"队伍告诉她在改变主意之前赶紧离开。  

Misasa紧张地感谢队伍，开始犹豫地离开。看来她并没有想到冒险者们真的会放她走。

Misasa looked like she wanted to say something but then stopped. With a sad expression she said quietly:
""I...understand. I give myself up to the soldiers. I-I'm sorry."" 

She stood up and started walking towards the sounds of battle. There was a chance that she was only trying to find an opportunity to escape but for some reason the adventurers were sure that she actually meant what she said.",56,"队伍告诉她，她必须对自己所做的事情负责。她是强盗的一部分，因此对他们的罪行负有责任。  

Misasa看起来想说些什么，但随后停住了。她带着悲伤的表情低声说道：  
“我……明白了。我自首给士兵。我……对不起。”  

她站起身，开始朝着战斗的声音走去。她有可能只是想寻找逃跑的机会，但出于某种原因，冒险者们确信她说的是真心话。"

She whimpered when she saw Alissa's angry face. 

Alissa was pissed.

""You think you can just run away?!"" she yelled at Misasa. ""You think you can just absolve yourself of your crimes just by disappearing? Do you know how many people suffered because of the bandits?""
It was clear that Alissa was thinking of what has happened to herself.

",56,"在任何人能说话之前，Alissa向前一步，给了强盗女孩Misasa一巴掌。Misasa看起来对发生的事情感到有些困惑。  
当她看到Alissa愤怒的脸时，她呜咽了一声。  

Alissa非常生气。  

“你以为你可以就这样逃跑？！”她对Misasa吼道。“你以为你可以通过消失来洗清自己的罪行？你知道因为强盗而受苦的人有多少吗？”  
显然，Alissa在想自己所经历的事情。"

“我……对不起！我从来没有想过要伤害任何人！”她低声说道。  

Alissa又给了她一巴掌。“当你逃跑时，你的道歉毫无意义。”Alissa毫无怜悯地说道。  

“那，我该怎么办？！”Misasa开始哭泣。“我……我知道这是错的……我知道我应该做些什么……但是……我……*抽泣*……就是不知道该怎么做……总是这样*抽泣*！我从来无法为自己做决定。*抽泣*即使现在我也不知道该怎么做才能弥补。”"

""I'll do it! I'll do it!"" Misasa yelled terrified while holding her cheeks. ""Y-you're right! I-I will do anything I can to help you bring down the boss. I-I mean the bandit king!""


",56,"“帮助我们。”Alissa回应道。  

“什……什么？”  

“我说帮助我们！帮助我们推翻强盗王。如果你想弥补，就从你应该一开始就做的事情开始！”
