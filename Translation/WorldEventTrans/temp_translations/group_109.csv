The Scourge of Mankind, The Harbinger of Death and Destruction, The Destroyer of Worlds and many more; all the titles and epithets that once instilled fear in the hearts of all who heard them now served only as testament to their triumph over the mighty beast. It was a feat that would echo through the annals of history as one of the greatest achievements of their time. 

However, before the adventurers could celebrate and let it all go to their heads, they remembered the young man lying on the ground, barely clinging to life. They rushed to his side, tending to his wounds immediately as best as they could. As they tended to him, they asked if he knew of a man named ""Zephyrion"".

""T-that's me,"" he replied, his voice barely above a whisper as he summoned the last ounce of his strength. With those words, he fell unconscious, his body finally succumbing to the exhaustion and pain that the whole ordeal has brought to him.",340,"这真是一个奇迹……冒险者们击败了恐怖的沃拉萨克斯。人类的灾难，死亡与毁灭的先驱，世界的毁灭者，以及更多曾让所有听到这些称号的人心生恐惧的名号，如今只作为他们战胜强大野兽的见证。这是一项将铭刻在历史长河中的伟大成就。

然而，在冒险者们庆祝并陶醉于胜利之前，他们想起了躺在地上、勉强维持生命的年轻人。他们立刻冲到他身边，尽力为他处理伤口。在照顾他的同时，他们问他是否知道一个名叫“泽菲里昂”的人。

“那……是我，”他回答，声音微弱得几乎听不见，努力召集最后一丝力气。说完这些话，他便失去了知觉，身体终于屈服于整个事件带来的疲惫与痛苦。"
1834454431469570,WORLDEVENT341_PAGE1,"As the adventurers and the Guild Master entered the room, they found themselves surrounded by a large group of all too familiar enemies. Goblins, Lephoz, Jotuns, Vampires, Cultists; individuals from various races and regions had united under a common banner, devoted to serving the demon lords.  Among this assembly of dark forces, their leader, the chosen of the demon lords, the Witch, stood prominently.

""I suppose it was inevitable that you would discover my sanctuary, Guild Master,"" the witch remarked with a hint of sardonic humor. ""I offered you a different path, an alternative to the conflict we now find ourselves embroiled in. You could have continued to lead your little Guild, hunting monsters and brigands, and left us to our pursuits. Yet, you chose differently.""",341,"当冒险者和公会会长走进房间时，他们发现自己被一大群熟悉的敌人包围。哥布林、雷佛兹、巨人、吸血鬼、邪教徒；来自不同种族和地区的个体在一个共同的旗帜下团结，致力于服务于恶魔领主。在这股黑暗势力的集会中，他们的首领，恶魔领主的选民，女巫，显得格外显眼。

“我想你们发现我的庇护所是不可避免的，公会会长，”女巫带着一丝讽刺的幽默说道。“我曾为你提供另一条道路，一个与我们现在卷入的冲突不同的选择。你本可以继续领导你的小公会，猎杀怪物和强盗，而将我们留给我们的追求。然而，你选择了不同的道路。”"
1834454431469571,WORLDEVENT341_PAGE2,"""Instead, you followed orders which you do not understand yourself. Do you truly believe the gods have dispatched you to confront me solely to safeguard a few human souls?"" A brief silence hung in the room, thick with tension. ""I guess it doesn't matter. All that matters is that you have chosen to oppose us."" the witch declared, as an aura of darkness enveloped her and malevolent crimson light emanated from the eye sockets of her bone mask.

""Let us bring this conflict to a close, Guild Master. You and your Adventurer Guild shall never stand in my way again!""",341,"“相反，你遵循了你自己都不理解的命令。你真的相信神明派遣你来对抗我，仅仅是为了保护几个无辜的人类灵魂吗？”房间里短暂的沉默弥漫着紧张的气氛。“我想这无所谓。重要的是你们选择了反对我们。”女巫宣告，黑暗的气息将她笼罩，恶意的红光从她骨面具的眼窝中散发出来。

“让我们结束这场冲突，公会会长。你和你的冒险者公会再也无法阻挡我！”"
1834454435663872,WORLDEVENT342_PAGE1,"It was over.

The defeated Witch knelt before the adventurers and the Guild Master, her fate completely in their hands. Despite her defeat her gaze met theirs, unyielding, refusing to beg or seek mercy.

The Guild Master understood what has to be done and asked one of the adventurers to do the deed. A blade was drawn and as the adventurer was about to strike the witch a booming voice stopped them.

""Do not harm her!""
",342,"一切都结束了。

被击败的女巫跪在冒险者和公会会长面前，她的命运完全掌握在他们手中。尽管她失败了，但她的目光与他们相遇，坚定不移，拒绝乞求或寻求怜悯。

公会会长明白必须做什么，并要求一位冒险者来执行这个任务。一把刀被拔出，当冒险者准备攻击女巫时，一个洪亮的声音制止了他们。

“不要伤害她！”"
1834454435663873,WORLDEVENT342RESULT0_PAGE1,"The Guild Master turned to see that the Divine Messenger and her bodyguard had arrived. Relief washed over the Guild Master briefly, knowing the Divine Messenger was safe. However, that relief was swiftly replaced by unease, when they realized that there was something off about the Divine Messenger. Her eyes shimmered with an ethereal light, and her voice carried an otherworldly resonance.

It didn't take long until they understood the situation. The gods had taken over her.

The Divine Messenger moved past the adventurers, who stood frozen in awe and confusion, unsure how to comport themselves before the embodiment of divinity. But the possessed Divine Messenger paid them no heed, focusing her attention on the Witch, who returned her gaze with a fierce, unyielding hatred.

""Where is the emperor's body?"" The divine voice resonated in an otherworldly tone, directed at the Witch. She didn't answer.",342,"公会会长转身看到神圣使者和她的护卫已经到达。公会会长感到一阵轻松，知道神圣使者安全。然而，这种轻松很快被不安取代，当他们意识到神圣使者身上有些不对劲。她的眼睛闪烁着超凡的光芒，声音带着异界的共鸣。

不久，他们便明白了情况。神明已经占据了她的身体。

神圣使者越过那些惊愕不已、困惑不解的冒险者，专注于女巫，女巫以一种强烈而坚定的仇恨回视着她。

“皇帝的尸体在哪里？”神圣的声音以异界的音调响起，直指女巫。她没有回答。"
1834454435663874,WORLDEVENT342RESULT0_PAGE2,"The Divine Messenger raised her hand, casting a blinding light upon the Witch, who writhed in agony as if submerged in scalding water. Once the torment ceased, the question was repeated, and yet the Witch remained silent. The process was repeated time and again, and each time, the Witch's cries pierced the chamber. The adventurers watched in horror as a person was being subjected to torture before their eyes.

Finally the Guild Master stepped in and held the divine Messenger back.
""That's enough."" The Guild Master said with slight unease. ""She is already unconscious."" The Witch lay sprawled on the ground, seemingly lifeless, except for the subtle rise and fall of her chest indicating that she still drew breath.


",342,"神圣使者举起手，向女巫施下耀眼的光芒，女巫在痛苦中扭动，仿佛被浸泡在滚烫的水中。当折磨停止后，问题再次被重复，但女巫依然保持沉默。这个过程一次又一次地重复，每次女巫的尖叫声刺破了房间。冒险者们惊恐地看着，眼前的这一幕仿佛是对一个人的折磨。

最终，公会会长出面制止了这一切，拉住了神圣使者。“够了。”公会会长略显不安地说道。“她已经失去知觉。”女巫瘫倒在地上，似乎没有生命，只有胸口微微起伏，表明她仍在呼吸。"
1834454435663875,WORLDEVENT342RESULT0_PAGE3,"The Divine Messenger's gaze turned toward the Guild Master. The divine presence lacked any trace of empathy, and for an instant, the Guild Master felt an instinctual fear, their hand moving toward their weapon. However, the Divine Messenger relented.

""Bring her back to the Guild. There is a dungeon in your fortress where we can continue the questioning when she regains consciousness,"" the divine voice commanded, leaving no room for negotiation.

""Alright,"" the Guild Master responded, still one hand on their weapon. ""But first, allow the Divine Messenger to regain control of her body. We will take it from here."" The request hung heavily in the air, leaving all present uncertain as to whether the divine entity would abide. However, the glowing eyes of the Divine Messenger finally dimmed, and she sank to her knees.

",342,"神圣使者的目光转向公会会长。神圣的存在毫无同情的痕迹，公会会长在瞬间感到一种本能的恐惧，手不自觉地向武器移动。然而，神圣使者却放弃了抵抗。

“把她带回公会。在你们的堡垒里有一个地牢，我们可以在她恢复意识后继续审问。”神圣的声音命令道，毫无商量的余地。

“好的，”公会会长回应，仍然一只手握着武器。“但首先，请让神圣使者重新控制她的身体。接下来由我们来处理。”这个请求在空气中沉重地悬挂着，让在场的所有人都不确定这个神圣的存在是否会同意。然而，神圣使者的光芒终于黯淡下来，她跪倒在地。"
1834454435663876,WORLDEVENT342RESULT0_PAGE4,"The Divine Messenger gasped for air as if she has been drowning. Her whole body trembled as she clutched her arms as if she feared being separated from her body once more.
Then something unexpected happened...the Divine Messenger started to cry. 

Tears streamed down her cheeks as she wept.

Her sobbing was the only sound that echoed the chamber
",342,"神圣使者喘着气，仿佛刚刚溺水而出。她全身颤抖，紧紧抱住自己的手臂，仿佛害怕再次与自己的身体分离。然后，意想不到的事情发生了……神圣使者开始哭泣。

泪水顺着她的脸颊流下，她痛哭不已。

她的抽泣声是唯一在房间里回荡的声音。"
