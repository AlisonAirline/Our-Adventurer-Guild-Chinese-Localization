Knowing that there were two separate sites where the catapults were seen, Rogue volunteered to handle one location alone, urging the adventurers to take care of the second. The group agreed, and they separated soon after, each sneaking towards their assigned location.

As the adventurers approached the catapults at their assigned location, the sight of guards protecting the siege engines met their eyes. This was anticipated, and the real challenge now lay in dealing with the guards without raising an alarm in the main camp.",249,"在夜幕的掩护下，Rogue和一群冒险者悄悄离开了公会，朝着已知的投石机位置前进。知道有两个不同的地点曾见到投石机，Rogue主动提出独自处理一个地点，催促冒险者们去照顾另一个。队伍同意了，随后他们分开，各自悄悄朝着指定的位置前进。

当冒险者们接近指定地点的投石机时，眼前出现了守卫保护着这些攻城器械。这是预料之中的，真正的挑战在于如何在不惊动主营的情况下处理这些守卫。"
