So buffed was he that the Party instinctively got themself combat-ready. Seeing that, the buff man just laughed and said ""Easy there folks. I'm not looking for trouble."" The Party eased up a little but were still a little bit uncomfortable.

他如此强壮，以至于队伍本能地做好了战斗准备。看到这一幕，壮汉只是笑了笑，说：“放轻松，伙计们。我并不想惹麻烦。”队伍稍微放松了一些，但仍然感到有些不安。

 Unless of course, you don't feel up to the task, which I could fully well understand."" 

It was obvious to the Party that this wasn't about getting to know people and doubted there was any place with that kind of custom. It was obvious the man just wanted to flaunt his superiority at them.",161,"“太好了！”壮汉狡黠地笑了。  

“你知道，在我来自的地方，有一种习俗是和强者进行摔跤。这是结识人的好方法。那么，怎么样？我们也来试试？  
当然，如果你们觉得不够强，那我完全可以理解。”  

队伍很明显意识到这并不是为了结识朋友，并怀疑根本没有那种习俗。显然，这个男人只是想向他们炫耀自己的优越。"
