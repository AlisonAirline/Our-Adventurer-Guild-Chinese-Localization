A faint, flickering soul remained concealed in a corner, small and youthful, barely noticeable.

{CHARACTER1} could sense its fear and confusion about its situation. The soul seemed to lack understanding of what had transpired, or perhaps it did comprehend but wasn't ready to move on.

As it gazed at {CHARACTER1}, or at least {CHARACTER1} believed it did, there was a sense of understanding that the adventurers meant no harm.
