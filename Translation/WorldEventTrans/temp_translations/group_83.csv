1834454238531589,WORLDEVENT259_PAGE1,"As the first day of the siege unfolded, the Guild Master, armed with a spyglass provided by Me'can, carefully observed the movements of the enemy army from the walls. The sounds of axes against trees echoed through the air as the invaders began chopping down the surrounding forest to procure materials for their siege equipment.

Through the spyglass, the Guild Master could see wooden ladders under construction. It was evident, that the enemy intended to assault the walls sooner than later.

Even more worrisome, however, was the realization that the enemy was also working on catapults. The knowledge that bombardment might soon commence filled the Guild Master with a silent dread. Yet, the Guild Master knew that, for now, there was little they could do to prevent the enemy's preparations. The defenders were left with no choice but to watch and wait, hoping for any signs or hints that might aid them in surviving the siege.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting shadows over the besieged fortress, the first day of the siege concluded without any direct confrontation. The night settled in, and the Guild Master left the rest of the observation to one of the adventurers while retiring to their bed. However, it proved to be a very sleepless night.
",259,"在围城的第一天，公会会长手持梅卡恩提供的望远镜，仔细观察敌军在城墙上的动向。随着入侵者开始砍伐周围的森林以获取攻城器械的材料，斧头与树木碰撞的声音在空气中回荡。

通过望远镜，公会会长可以看到正在建造的木梯。显然，敌人打算不久后就对城墙发起攻击。

然而，更令人担忧的是，敌人还在制造投石机。即将开始轰炸的消息让公会会长心中充满了无声的恐惧。然而，公会会长知道，目前他们几乎无能为力去阻止敌人的准备。防守者别无选择，只能静观其变，期待任何可能帮助他们在围城中生存的迹象或线索。

当太阳沉入地平线，阴影笼罩着被围困的堡垒时，围城的第一天在没有直接冲突的情况下结束。夜幕降临，公会会长将观察的其余部分留给一位冒险者，自己则回到床上。然而，这却是一个无眠的夜晚。"
1834454242725888,WORLDEVENT259_PAGE2,"On the second day of the siege, the routine of the enemy army remained unchanged. Their focus still remained on the construction of their siege equipments, and once again, there was no direct assault on the fortress.

However, a small commotion occurred when it was discovered that Me'can, the merchant had mysteriously disappeared. The news circulated among the defenders, giving rise to whispers and speculation. The sudden vanishing act fueled rumors among the adventurers, that there might be a hidden tunnel within the Guild. However, as much they tried to find one, there was none to be found.

The Guild Master, accustomed to Me'can's mysterious nature, didn't dwell too much on the merchant's disappearance.  Me'can has always been an enigmatic figure. For him to be able to just leave a besieged fortress on a whim, did not surprise the Guild Master. Instead the Guild Master maintained their vigilance over the enemy's activities. The construction of siege equipment progressed at an alarming rate. The wooden ladders were nearing completion, and the catapults were also close to being finished. It was a disheartening sight, with the only upside being that the second day also ended peacefully. 

However, that would not last long.
",259,"在围城的第二天，敌军的日常活动没有改变。他们仍然专注于攻城器械的建造，再次没有对堡垒发起直接攻击。

然而，当发现商人梅卡恩神秘失踪时，发生了一小阵骚动。这个消息在防守者中传播，引发了低声议论和猜测。梅卡恩的突然消失在冒险者中激起了关于公会内部可能隐藏隧道的传言。然而，尽管他们努力寻找，却没有找到任何隧道。

公会会长习惯了梅卡恩神秘的性格，并没有过多关注商人的失踪。梅卡恩一直是个难以捉摸的人物。对于他能够随心所欲地离开被围困的堡垒，公会会长并不感到惊讶。相反，公会会长继续保持对敌人活动的警惕。攻城器械的建造进展迅速，木梯接近完工，投石机也快要完成。这是一幅令人沮丧的景象，唯一的好消息是第二天也平静地结束了。

然而，这种平静不会持续太久。"
1834454242725889,WORLDEVENT259RESULT0_PAGE1,"The tranquility of the siege ended on the third day as violent screams echoed through the Guild. The Guild Master rushed to the walls to witness a horrifying sight. The enemy had commenced their bombardment, hurling massive boulders into the heart of the fortress. The boulders soared above the walls, descending upon the defenders with destructive force. The enemy's strategy became clear; they weren't targeting the walls but instead sought to inflict casualties among the defenders. It seemed the attackers had deemed a direct assault on the walls too time-consuming and opted for a tactic that aimed to weaken the defenders before a potential assault.

Chaos erupted within the Guild as adventurers scrambled for cover, seeking refuge from the deadly hail of boulders. The air filled with the deafening crashes of boulders colliding with the Guild's structures, mixed with the screams of the unfortunate souls caught in the open, buried beneath one of the colossal stones. 

How long could they last this?",259,"在围城的第三天，宁静被打破，剧烈的尖叫声在公会中回荡。公会会长急忙赶到城墙，目睹了令人恐惧的景象。敌人开始了轰炸，向堡垒的核心投掷巨石。巨石在城墙上空飞过，带着毁灭性的力量降落在防守者身上。敌人的策略变得清晰；他们并不是针对城墙，而是试图在防守者中造成伤亡。看来攻击者认为直接攻击城墙太耗时，选择了一种旨在削弱防守者的战术，以便在潜在的攻击之前进行。

公会内陷入混乱，冒险者们四处寻找掩护，试图躲避致命的巨石雨。空气中充斥着巨石撞击公会建筑的震耳欲聋的声响，夹杂着那些不幸被困在外面、埋在巨石下的灵魂的尖叫声。

他们能撑多久？"
1834454242725890,WORLDEVENT260_PAGE1,"On the fifth day, an eerie calm settled over the fortress. The enemy, instead of launching another assault, seemed content to simply maintain their siege and leave the defenders alone. The Guild Master couldn't shake a nagging sense of unease over the sudden change of tactics.

Throughout the day, the defenders remained vigilant, their eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of movement. Tensions lingered, and the fortress was enveloped in an atmosphere of cautious anticipation. However, as the sun dipped below the skyline, the day concluded without any incidents.",260,"在第五天，堡垒上笼罩着一种诡异的平静。敌人没有发起新的攻击，似乎满足于维持围困，任由防守者独处。公会会长无法摆脱对这种突如其来的战术变化的隐隐不安。

整天，防守者们保持警惕，目光扫视地平线，寻找任何动静的迹象。紧张的气氛弥漫，堡垒笼罩在小心翼翼的期待中。然而，当太阳沉入天际，白天在没有任何事件的情况下结束。"
1834454242725891,WORLDEVENT260RESULT0_PAGE1,"The sixth day started with a horrifying revelation that sent shockwaves through the fortress – the Guild's supply store had been set ablaze. The Guild Master, responding immediately to the report, arrived at the scene only to find the store completely destroyed. Nothing was left.

The Guild Master's mind raced with questions. Was this the work of the enemy, and was it the reason they decided to take their time? If so, how did they know where the supplies were gathered, and how did they get in? Despite the numerous questions, the Guild Master had no answers, but there was no time to dwell on uncertainties anyway.
",260,"第六天开始时，堡垒传来了一个可怕的消息，震惊了所有人——公会的储备仓库被放火了。公会会长立即响应报告，赶到现场，却发现仓库已经完全被毁，什么都没有留下。

公会会长的脑海中充满了疑问。这是敌人的所为吗？这是否是他们决定拖延时间的原因？如果是，他们是如何知道储备物资在哪里的？又是如何进入的？尽管有无数问题，公会会长却没有答案，但此时也没有时间去纠结于不确定性。"
1834454246920192,WORLDEVENT260RESULT0_PAGE2,"The Guild Master issued orders to search for any signs of intruders and commanded everyone to pool together whatever food could be salvaged from personal reserves within the Guild. At the end of the day, no intruders could be found, and the gathered food supply was woefully insufficient to sustain the besieged adventurers for more than a few days, even with the strictest rationing. 

Days seven to nine were peaceful, but the fortress remained on edge.  The lack of food weighed heavily on the morale of the adventurers, and it didn't improve with the threat of an still unknown intruder amongst their midst. The only thing they could do was to double the guards at the gate to prevent any possible attempt to open it from within. However, as the Guild Master's stomach rumbled, they wondered how much longer they could last.",260,"公会会长下令寻找任何入侵者的迹象，并命令大家尽量从公会内的个人储备中收集可 salvaged 的食物。到一天结束时，没有找到任何入侵者，而收集到的食物供应对于被围困的冒险者来说，连几天的维持都显得极其不足，即使是严格配给的情况下。

第七到第九天平静无事，但堡垒仍然处于紧张状态。缺乏食物严重影响了冒险者的士气，而在他们中间潜伏着一个仍然未知的入侵者的威胁并没有改善这一情况。他们唯一能做的就是加倍守卫城门，以防止任何可能的内部打开尝试。然而，随着公会会长的肚子咕咕作响，他们不禁想知道自己还能撑多久。"
1834454246920193,WORLDEVENT261_PAGE1,"On the dawn of the tenth day of the siege, an unusual atmosphere hung in the air.

Something was amiss, and the Guild Master couldn't quite put their finger on it. Something smelled wrong...or rather good? 

Driven by curiosity, the Guild Master hurried outside, finding fellow adventurers already gathered in the courtyard. Now here, the Guild Master could finally tell what was wrong. Somebody was cooking a meal! ",261,"在围城的第十天黎明，空气中弥漫着一种不寻常的气氛。

有什么地方不对劲，公会会长却无法确切指出。似乎有什么东西闻起来不对……或者说是好闻？

出于好奇，公会会长匆匆走出，发现其他冒险者已经聚集在院子里。现在，在这里，公会会长终于可以分辨出问题所在。有人在做饭！"
1834454246920194,WORLDEVENT261RESULT0_PAGE1,"It was in fact Me'can, who was cooking a giant pot of stew over a makeshift campfire.

Greeting them with a playful tone, Me'can exclaimed, ""What a shame. You all woke up earlier than I expected. I wanted to surprise you with breakfast, just like my mother used to cook for me.""

With Me'can's return came crates filled with food, a welcome sight for the hungry and fatigued adventurers.  This was such a welcoming sight to the Guild Master that they didn't dare to question how Me'can managed to enter the Guild or, how he managed to carry all the supplies inside or how he even knew that they were starving. None of it mattered.

Adventurers eagerly assisted Me'can in preparing the meals, and soon, everyone enjoyed their first proper meal in days. 
",261,"事实上，是梅卡恩正在一个简易营火上煮一大锅炖菜。

梅卡恩用调皮的语气打招呼：“真可惜，你们比我预想的早醒来。我想给你们准备早餐，就像我母亲以前为我做的那样。”

随着梅卡恩的归来，装满食物的箱子也随之而来，这对饥饿疲惫的冒险者来说是个可喜的景象。对于公会会长来说，这样的景象让他们不敢质疑梅卡恩是如何进入公会的，或者他是如何把所有的物资搬进来的，甚至是他怎么知道他们在挨饿的。这些都不重要。

冒险者们热切地帮助梅卡恩准备食物，很快，大家享用了几天以来的第一顿正餐。"
1834454246920195,WORLDEVENT261RESULT0_PAGE2,"In a moment of privacy, the Guild Master expressed gratitude to Me'can for the supplies. However, the tone shifted unexpectedly when Me'can made an unexpected admission.

Without skipping a beat he said: ""I poisoned the food, Guild Master.""

The courtyard fell silent as Me'can's unexpected revelation echoed through the air. Adventurers halted their eating, their expressions shifting to horror as they processed the shocking statement. The atmosphere hung heavy with tension until, to everyone's surprise, both the Guild Master and Me'can began to laugh.

""I see you finally get my humor!"" Me'can declared mischieviously. The initial shock gave way to a wave of relieved laughter as others joined in, breaking the tension. Finally, laughter has returned to the Guild.",261,"在一个私密的时刻，公会会长对梅卡恩的物资表示感谢。然而，当梅卡恩做出意外的坦白时，语气却突然转变。

他毫不犹豫地说：“我在食物中下了毒，公会会长。”

院子里瞬间安静下来，梅卡恩的意外揭露在空气中回荡。冒险者们停止了进食，表情转为恐惧，试图消化这个震惊的声明。气氛中弥漫着紧张，直到出乎所有人意料的是，公会会长和梅卡恩都开始大笑。

“我看你终于懂我的幽默了！”梅卡恩顽皮地宣称。最初的震惊让位于一阵松了一口气的笑声，其他人也加入其中，打破了紧张的气氛。最终，笑声重新回到了公会中。"
