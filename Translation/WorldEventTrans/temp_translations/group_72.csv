How much you ask?...How about enough to completely fill up my storage room?"" the old woman said and pointed to a little house big enough to probably fit two whole trolls in it.",224,"""我希望你们做的第一件事就是为我劈一些柴火。我剩下的可不多了。你问我需要多少？……那就足够填满我的储藏室吧？""老妇人说道，并指向一间小房子，里面大概能容纳两个完整的巨魔。"

It was hard work, but none of the adventurers had any trouble with the physically demanding work, and it didn't take long until they chopped enough wood to last for a lifetime. Despite the good work the party did, the old woman looked slightly dissappointed.",224,冒险者们开始砍伐附近的树木，并用楔子劈开木材。这是一项艰苦的工作，但没有一个冒险者对这种体力劳动感到困难，不久他们就劈出了足够一辈子用的柴火。尽管队伍的工作做得很好，老妇人看起来还是有些失望。

Or at least what little lifetime the old woman had left, thought one of them.",224,冒险者们开始砍伐附近的树木，并用楔子劈开木材。这是一项艰苦的工作，并不是每个人都适合。保持节奏很困难，因此他们花了很长时间才终于劈出足够一辈子用的柴火。或者至少是老妇人剩下的那一点点生命，队伍中的一人这样想。

""Now, I'd like you to check on my traps. I put a lot of them in an area where there is usually a high amount of critters. It would be a great help if you could check if they caught anything. 
But be careful! I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty good in setting up hard-to-spot traps. So, you need to be careful while searching. They're meant for small sized critters, so you don't have to worry too much about any lasting injuries.""",225,"""大家的工作真棒！有了这些，我就不用担心柴火一段时间了！不过，我希望你们还没有完成。还有一些事情我希望你们能帮我做。""

""现在，我希望你们去检查一下我的陷阱。我在一个通常有很多小动物的地方放了很多陷阱。如果你们能检查一下有没有捕到什么，那将是个很大的帮助。  
但要小心！我不想自夸，但我在设置难以发现的陷阱方面相当不错。所以，你们在寻找时要小心。它们是为小型动物准备的，所以你们不必太担心会造成什么严重的伤害。"""

They were skillfully laid in a way where they perfectly blended with their environment. It wouldn't be that surprising to accidentally set off a trap even if you did know where the traps were laid. But thanks to {CHARACTER1}'s perceptive eyes, the party was able to identify all the traps without any harm.

After collecting all the critters that got caught in the traps, they returned to the old woman who looked at the adventurers and gave a silent sigh.",225,"当老妇人说陷阱难以发现时，她并不是在开玩笑。它们被巧妙地布置，完美地融入了环境中。即使你知道陷阱放在哪里，意外触发陷阱也并不奇怪。但多亏了{CHARACTER1}敏锐的眼睛，队伍能够在没有任何伤害的情况下识别出所有陷阱。
