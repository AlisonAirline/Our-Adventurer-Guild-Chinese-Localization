In front of them stood a giant fortress. An old abandoned empyrean fortress that had been claimed by the Adventurer Guild several years ago. It now acts as a base of operations for the Adventurer Guild.

In front of the fortress stands an old familiar face...",337,"最终，队伍达到了他们的目的地。  

在他们面前矗立着一座巨大的堡垒。这是一座古老的废弃天界堡垒，几年前被冒险者公会占领。现在它作为冒险者公会的行动基地。  

在堡垒前，站着一张熟悉的老面孔……"
1834454427275266,WORLDEVENT338_PAGE1,"Gathered around a makeshift campfire, a group of adventurers sat together, and Tavi was seen distributing cups of beer to everyone. Spotting the Guild Master and their fellow adventurers, she approached and handed them drinks too.

""Just for today, on the house!"" she announced with a warm smile. 

The alcohol wouldn't still their hunger, but it could offer a bit of comfort in these challenging times.

Vincent occupied a stool near the campfire, skillfully playing his lute. His condition seemed surprisingly better than many others, making the Guild Master wonder if Vincent possessed an unexpected resilience they hadn't expected from him. However, a closer look revealed the subtle application of makeup, hinting at a conscious effort to maintain appearances. Meeting the Guild Master's gaze, Vincent responded with a smile, urging them not to shatter the facade.",338,"一群冒险者围坐在临时营火旁，塔维正在给每个人分发啤酒。看到公会会长和其他冒险者，她走上前去，也把饮料递给他们。  

“今天就请大家喝，免费！”她面带温暖的微笑宣布。  

酒精无法抑制他们的饥饿，但在这个艰难的时刻，它可以提供一点安慰。  

文森特坐在营火旁的一张凳子上，熟练地弹奏着他的鲁特琴。他的状态似乎比许多人都要好，这让公会会长不禁想知道，文森特是否拥有他们未曾预料到的意外韧性。然而，仔细一看，脸上微妙的妆容暗示着他在努力维持外表。文森特与公会会长的目光相遇，微笑着回应，暗示他们不要打破这个假象。"
1834454427275267,WORLDEVENT338RESULT0_PAGE1,"Vincent began to play the song he had composed about the Adventurer Guild. He sang of their humble origins and their earnest endeavors to make a living. He recounted their trials and tribulations at the hands of the Bandit King, their involvement in divine matters, and their triumph over the witch. Vincent sang of the adventurers' accomplishments, the fallen comrades, their sacrifices, heroism, and above all, their humanity. The song concluded with a powerful message, emphasizing that they were heroes, and heroes don't fall easily.

The performance struck a chord with the audience, and some were moved to tears. Many of the adventurers had joined the guild at their lowest points, and not many had told them that their lives mattered. In response, cheers erupted, and the rallying cry ""For the Adventurer Guild!"" echoed through the air. The Guild Master, too, joined in.",338,"文森特开始演奏他为冒险者公会创作的歌曲。他唱着他们的谦卑起源和为生存而努力的真诚。他回忆起他们在强盗王手下的磨难与考验，他们参与神圣事务，以及他们战胜女巫的胜利。文森特歌颂了冒险者们的成就，提到了牺牲的战友、他们的英雄主义，以及最重要的，他们的人性。歌曲以一个强有力的信息结束，强调他们是英雄，而英雄不会轻易倒下。  

表演打动了观众，许多人感动得泪流满面。许多冒险者在最低谷时加入了公会，鲜有人告诉他们，他们的生命是有意义的。对此，欢呼声响起，口号“为了冒险者公会！”在空气中回荡。公会会长也加入了其中。"
1834454427275268,WORLDEVENT339_PAGE1,"The adventurers stood in awe and terror as they beheld Vorathax, the dreaded red dragon, in all his monstrous glory. His massive form loomed over them, exuding an aura of power and malice that sent shivers down their spines. 

Before him lay a young man, broken and helpless. Vorathax watched the young man writhes on the ground with broken legs, like it was some kind of sick form of entertainment to take pleasure in.

",339,"冒险者们惊恐而敬畏地站着，目睹了可怕的红龙沃拉萨克，展现出他那可怕的威严。他庞大的身躯在他们面前高高耸立，散发着一种强大而恶意的气息，让他们不寒而栗。  

在他面前躺着一个年轻人，破碎而无助。沃拉萨克看着年轻人在地上扭动，双腿断裂，仿佛这是一种病态的娱乐，让他感到快意。"
1834454431469568,WORLDEVENT339_PAGE2,"As Vorathax turned his gaze upon the adventurers, his voice thundered in their minds. ""More mice have arrived,"" he mused, without even really acknowledging them. ""Have they come to save their little mouse friend? Or are they just confused rats charging into death?"" Vorathax's words were  laced with sadistic amusement. ""Perhaps ending their lives will prove more entertaining than watching this pathetic creature's futile struggle for life,"" he continued, his words directed more at himself than the adventurers. Human beings were not creatures to converse with; they were merely playthings, disposable toys for his personal amusement.

With a sadistic grin, Vorathax rose to his feet, towering over them with his massive body. Without waiting for a reply, he prepared to unleash his wrath upon them, relishing the thought of the impending carnage.

Vorathax The Terror has started his attack.",339,"当沃拉萨克将目光转向冒险者们时，他的声音在他们的脑海中轰鸣。“更多的小老鼠来了，”他若有所思地说，甚至没有真正理会他们。“他们是来救他们的小老鼠朋友的吗？还是只是迷失的老鼠，冲向死亡？”沃拉萨克的话语中带着虐待狂的愉悦。“也许结束他们的生命会比看这个可怜生物无谓的挣扎更有趣，”他继续说道，这些话更多是对自己说的，而不是对冒险者。人类并不是可以交谈的生物；他们只是玩物，是他个人娱乐的可抛弃玩具。  

沃拉萨克露出一个虐待狂的微笑，站起身来，庞大的身躯高高在上。没有等待回应，他准备向他们释放他的愤怒，享受即将到来的屠杀的想法。  

沃拉萨克恐怖者已经开始他的攻击。"
