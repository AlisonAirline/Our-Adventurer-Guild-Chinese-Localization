Prepare for battle!",268,"队伍终于遇到了巨魔。它是一团巨大的肌肉，毫无脂肪。它挥舞着一根巨大的木棒，大小足以将一个成年男子砸成血迹斑斑的污垢。  

它看着冒险者，露出了得意的微笑。它对那些仍然存在的小哥布林咆哮着，少数的哥布林立刻在它面前集合。它们知道，如果不想成为主人的腹中餐，就必须抓住一些冒险者。与巨魔及其哥布林的战斗即将开始。  

准备战斗吧！"

Giant spiders started to crawl down from the ceiling and the eggs started to wobble even harder. Amidst all of that the Spider Queen gave out an ear-deafening shriek.

It was the start signal to the Battle and powerful enough to stun and frighten those with lesser willpower.",269,"冒险者们进入了洞穴，气氛立刻发生了变化。数十只六只眼睛转向了冒险者。巨型蜘蛛开始从天花板上爬下，卵包开始更加剧烈地摇晃。在这一切之中，蜘蛛女王发出了震耳欲聋的尖叫。  

这是一场战斗的开始信号，足以震慑和吓倒意志力较弱的人。"

At some point the adventurers would probably have to deal with the Spiders that have escaped but for now they had one remaining task left. Destroying all the eggs that were still there.

Looking at the numbers of eggs that still remained, the adventurers sighed, already mentally exhausted. Nevertheless, they soon started with the destruction of the eggs. At least this was the easy part of their Quest.",270,"战斗胜利了！蜘蛛女王已经死去，剩下的几只巨型蜘蛛几乎立刻逃跑，留下它们的卵包给入侵者。  
在某个时刻，冒险者们可能还得处理那些逃跑的蜘蛛，但现在他们还有一项剩余的任务。摧毁所有仍然存在的卵包。  

看着剩下的卵包数量，冒险者们叹了口气，已经感到精神疲惫。然而，他们很快开始摧毁卵包。至少这部分是他们任务中最简单的。"
