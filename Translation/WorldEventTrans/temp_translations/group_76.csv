They started to shout any word that came to their mind while watching the ghost and everytime the ghost would just shake his head. From an outsider perspective it might have looked like they were playing a game of charades.
The party started to become frustrated by the lack of progress but clearly not as frustrated as the ghost was looking.",236,"小队继续尝试。他们开始大喊任何想到的词语，同时观察幽灵，而每次幽灵都会摇头。从外部的角度看，这可能像是在玩猜词游戏。

After several more guess the ghost finally  stopped moving and just kept on silently looking at them. Not sure what was happening the party started to draw their weapons and put some distance between themselves and the ghost.",237,"小队继续猜测，但每次猜测都未能命中，幽灵变得越来越沮丧。  
经过几次猜测后，幽灵终于停止了动作，静静地看着他们。小队不确定发生了什么，开始拔出武器，与幽灵保持了一定的距离。"
1834454175617031,WORLDEVENT237_DECISION2ALTRESULT0_PAGE2,"Suddenly the ghost let out a loud deafening shriek and more ghosts started to appear. The ghost looked at them and it was clear now that the ghost has finally lost himself again. Now his eyes were only filled with malice for the living.

Prepare to battle!",237,"突然，幽灵发出一声震耳欲聋的尖叫，更多的幽灵开始出现。幽灵看着他们，现在很明显幽灵终于再次失去了理智。此时他的眼中只充满了对生者的恶意。

1834454175617032,WORLDEVENT238_PAGE1,"The Party stumbled on yet another corpse but luckily unlike the other reanimated corpses they have encountered so far, this one remained motionless. What's even more interesting is that it looked like to be the corpse of some sort of ancient warrior. 

Although most of the equipment was beyond salvaging, the warrior had a fine-looking weapon that appeared to be in surprisingly good condition.",238,"小队又 stumbled 发现了一具尸体，但幸运的是，与他们迄今遇到的其他复活尸体不同，这具尸体保持静止。更有趣的是，这看起来像是一位古代战士的尸体。

Apparently, he disagrees. 

As soon as they attempted to remove the weapon from the warrior's grip, the corpse suddenly began to stir. Before the party could react, the warrior rose to his feet and howled at them. More corpses started to wander in from nearby.

A battle was about to unfold!",238,"小队决定带走这件武器。毕竟，这位战士再也用不上它了，不是吗？  

显然，他不同意。  

当他们试图从战士的手中取下武器时，尸体突然开始动了起来。在小队反应过来之前，战士站起身来对他们怒吼。更多的尸体开始从附近游荡过来。  

一场战斗即将展开！"
