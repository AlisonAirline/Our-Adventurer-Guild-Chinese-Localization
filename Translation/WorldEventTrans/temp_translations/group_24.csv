The twisted visage of madness was still still lingering on his face even after his demise. It made {CHARACTER1} wonder what the man has gone through, to end up like this.

Next to the fallen Slasher, lay the weapon Barret had requested to be retrieved.
Looking at it {CHARACTER1} couldn't help but be fascinated by it. The blade possessed a mesmerizing beauty, its crimson hue shining brightly and seemingly holding an otherworldly sharpness.

{CHARACTER1} took the blade. It was time to return to the Guild.",72,"道路屠杀者被击败了。他那不动的尸体躺在{CHARACTER1}的脚下。  
即使在他死后，扭曲的疯狂面容依然萦绕在他的脸上。这让{CHARACTER1}不禁思索，这个男人经历了什么，才会落得如此下场。  

在倒下的屠杀者旁边，放着巴雷特要求找回的武器。  
看着它，{CHARACTER1}不禁为之着迷。刀刃散发着迷人的美丽，鲜红的色泽闪耀着光辉，似乎蕴藏着超凡的锋利。

However, before {CHARACTER1} could attack the man, the man surrendered. It seems he realized that {CHARACTER1} would be faster than him and opted to beg for his life.

Hearing that, the man sighed in relief, although his face was slightly red from embarassment over how he acted.

He invited {CHARACTER1} to sit with him at the fire camp and eat with him. {CHARACTER1} took the invitation.

听到这话，那个人松了一口气，尽管因为自己的行为而脸上微微泛红。  

他邀请{CHARACTER1}和他一起坐在篝火旁吃饭。{CHARACTER1}接受了邀请。
