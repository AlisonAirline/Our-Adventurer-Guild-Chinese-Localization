From its appearance it was clear that this door wasn't originally part of this old fortress and the bandits have probably put it in this place to keep something safe.",59,当冒险者们转过拐角时，眼前出现了一扇巨大的钢门，似乎被一个复杂精巧的锁具锁住。从外观来看，这扇门显然并不是这座古老堡垒原本的一部分，强盗们可能是为了保护某些东西而将其放在这里。

The first hit jolted the door and the sound of the impact echoed through the corridor. They repeated their attack, putting their weight into every strike. Finally, with a loud groan, the door gave way and burst open. However, before the adventurers could congratulate themselves on their succcess, gas started to quickly fill the room, and they found themselves coughing and choking, struggling to breathe.",59,"冒险者们决定用力撞开门。他们退后，积蓄力量，朝着钢门发起集体冲锋。

第一次撞击使门剧烈震动，撞击声在走廊中回响。他们重复着攻击，将全身的力量投入每一次打击。最终，伴随着一声巨响，门应声而开。然而，在冒险者们还未来得及庆祝他们的成功时，气体迅速充满了房间，他们发现自己开始咳嗽和窒息，呼吸困难。"

As she put the key into the lock, she explained to the adventurers: ""I had to bring some loot in here once and got the key for it. But I forgot to return it and seemingly no one noticed. I-I wanted to return it, but then at the same day someone was killed because they thought he was stealing from the treasury. I was too afraid to return it afterwards.""

With a satisfying click, the lock opened, and Misasa opened the door. Inside the room, they found themselves surrounded by the ill-gotten loot of the bandits.",59,"“这、这是宝库房，”Misasa 低声说道。“粗暴处理可不是个好主意。这里布满了有毒气体的陷阱。”

“但是我确实有钥匙！”她一边说着，一边掏出一把钥匙。当她将钥匙插入锁中时，向冒险者们解释道：“我曾经带了一些战利品进来，得到了这把钥匙。但我忘了归还，似乎没有人注意到。我想归还，但就在那天，有人因为被认为是从宝库偷东西而被杀。我后来太害怕了，不敢归还。”
