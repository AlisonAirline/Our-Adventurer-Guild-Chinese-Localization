Seeing the children hugging their dog who was excitedly licking them, felt kinda rewarding for the Adventurers. They escorted the children and their dog out of this place. The children thanked the adventurers and promised to tell all the people in their village about their heroic deeds.
After the children left with their dog the Party resumed their business.",246,"队伍获胜了。他们成功地击杀了所有的不死生物，救下了那只狗。孩子们从藏身处跑了出来，他们的狗高兴地朝他们奔去。看到孩子们拥抱着兴奋地舔着他们的狗，这让冒险者们感到有些欣慰。他们护送孩子们和他们的狗离开了这个地方。孩子们感谢了冒险者，并承诺会把他们的英雄事迹告诉村子里的所有人。  
在孩子们带着狗离开后，队伍恢复了他们的事务。"
1834454209171463,WORLDEVENT247_PAGE1,"The adventurers stumbled upon a lone vampire in the old fortress and braced themselves for a confrontation. To their surprise though, the vampire did not exhibit any signs of hostility; instead, she greeted them with a disarming smile that sent a chill down their spines. Though her expression seemed genuine, it lacked the warmth one would expect from a friendly encounter.

""Please, my dears. There is no need for violence,"" the vampire spoke, her voice smooth and melodious. ""I understand the reputation that precedes my kind, but I assure you, I mean you no harm.""",247,"冒险者们在古老的堡垒中偶然发现了一只孤独的吸血鬼，准备迎接对抗。然而出乎他们意料的是，这只吸血鬼并没有表现出任何敌意；相反，她用一个迷人的微笑向他们打招呼，让他们感到一阵寒意。尽管她的表情看似真诚，但却缺乏友好相遇时应有的温暖。  
“请，我的亲爱的们。没有必要使用暴力，”吸血鬼说道，声音柔和而悦耳。“我理解我这一类生物所背负的名声，但我向你们保证，我对你们没有恶意。”"
1834454213365760,WORLDEVENT247_PAGE2,"The adventurers exchanged wary glances, their skepticism couldn't be more obvious.

""I can see you have doubts,"" the vampire continued, pulling out a small potion. ""You see, I've always considered being a vampire a great boon, but I admit that it has its downsides, especially when it comes to our relationship with humans. That's why I wondered if it wasn't possible to dilute the effects of vampirism; to create a being with the strengths of both vampire and human. A being that could mediate between humans and vampires.""",247,"冒险者们互相交换了警惕的目光，他们的怀疑显而易见。  
“我能看出你们有疑虑，”吸血鬼继续说道，拿出一小瓶药水。“你们看，我一直认为成为吸血鬼是一种巨大的恩赐，但我承认这也有其缺点，尤其是在我们与人类的关系上。这就是我想知道是否有可能稀释吸血鬼的影响；创造一种同时具备吸血鬼和人类优点的存在。一个可以在吸血鬼和人类之间调解的存在。”"
1834454213365761,WORLDEVENT247_PAGE3,"She smiled. 

""This potion is the result of that thought. It will give you the power of vampirism but without its inherent drawbacks.""

She held the vial aloft, tangling it in front of the adventurers like it was a prized posession.

""Consider it a gift, a token of my desire for peace between our peoples. Will you accept it?""",247,"她微笑着。  
“这瓶药水就是这个想法的结果。它将赋予你吸血鬼的力量，但没有其固有的缺陷。”  
她高高举起药水瓶，在冒险者面前晃动，就像这是一个珍贵的宝物。  
“把它当作礼物，作为我渴望我们民族之间和平的象征。你们会接受吗？”"
1834454213365762,WORLDEVENT247_DECISION1,Accept the vial.,247,接受药水。
1834454213365763,WORLDEVENT247_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE1,"The adventurers accepted the proposition, and true to her word, the vampire handed over the potion.

With a graceful movement, she dissolved into a mist, her form fading into the shadows. As she vanished, her voice echoed around them, carrying her final words:

""I cannot wait to see what you'll do with my gift.""",247,"冒险者们接受了这个提议，吸血鬼果然如她所言，递给了他们药水。  
随着一个优雅的动作，她化为一缕薄雾，身形渐渐消失在阴影中。当她消失时，她的声音在他们周围回荡，带着她的最后一句话：  
“我迫不及待想看看你们会如何使用我的礼物。”"
1834454213365764,WORLDEVENT247_DECISION2,Reject her gift.,247,拒绝她的礼物。
1834454213365765,WORLDEVENT247_DECISION2RESULT0_PAGE1,"The vampire's smile vanished swiftly at the adventurers' rejection.

""Fine,"" she spat, her tone dripping with disdain. ""If you want a brutish fight, then so be it. But don't presume I'm alone."" Suddenly, the air thickened with mist, coalescing into shadowy forms that materialized into additional vampires, surrounding the adventurers.

Prepare for battle!",247,"吸血鬼的微笑在冒险者的拒绝下迅速消失。  
“好吧，”她冷冷地说，语气中充满了轻蔑。“如果你们想要一场野蛮的战斗，那就随你们。但别以为我一个人。”突然，空气中弥漫着薄雾，凝聚成阴影的形态，化作更多的吸血鬼，包围了冒险者们。  
准备战斗！"
1834454213365766,WORLDEVENT248_PAGE1,"Rogue stood near the gate, her gaze fixed on the sky, watchful for any sign that the enemy assault might resume. When she noticed the Guild Master and the adventurers approaching, she stated, ""We have to do something about those catapults.""

""What did you have in mind?"" the Guild Master asked.

""The catapults are stationed somewhat outside their main army. If I go at night, I might be able to destroy some of their siege engines before they could respond,"" she explained, casting a glance at the adventurers. ""However, I don't think I can do this alone.""

It was undoubtedly a risky plan. Even if the catapults were positioned outside the main camp, they would likely be guarded at night. If caught, escaping back to the Guild might prove impossible.",248,"Rogue站在大门附近，目光紧盯着天空，警惕着敌人进攻可能再次开始的任何迹象。当她注意到公会会长和冒险者们走近时，她说道：“我们必须对那些投石机采取行动。”  
“你有什么想法？”公会会长问道。  
“投石机的位置在他们主力军队的外面。如果我在夜间出击，我可能能够在他们反应过来之前摧毁一些他们的攻城器械，”她解释道，瞥了一眼冒险者们。“不过，我觉得我无法单独完成这个任务。”  
这无疑是一个冒险的计划。即使投石机位于主营之外，夜间也很可能会有守卫。如果被抓住，逃回公会可能会变得不可能。"

The bombardment continued until finally night arrived.",248,"冒险者们同意加入Rogue的计划。  
“那么我只能祝你好运。我们在等着你，”公会会长说道。
