They scanned the area, searching for any sign of life, but there was nothing except for an ominous-looking shrine standing silently between two old statues.

They approached the shrine cautiously, hoping to find some clue or mechanism to initiate contact with the demon lord. They circled it, examining every inch for hidden symbols or markings, but their efforts yielded no results. It was apparent now.

Belephegor would not talk to them without Misasa.",221,"当冒险者们抵达神圣使者所指示的地点时，他们发现自己身处一座空荡荡的城堡。  
他们扫视四周，寻找任何生命的迹象，但除了两座古老雕像之间静静矗立的一个阴森神龛外，什么也没有。  

他们小心翼翼地靠近神龛，希望能找到一些线索或机制来与恶魔领主建立联系。他们围绕着神龛，仔细检查每一寸，寻找隐藏的符号或标记，但他们的努力没有任何结果。现在显而易见。  

贝勒菲戈不会在没有米萨萨的情况下与他们交谈。"

1834454129479680,WORLDEVENT222_PAGE1,"The adventurers stumbled upon a small notebook, carelessly abandoned on the floor. Scrawled across its cover was the name ""Allen"".

Majika began to sigh. ""How often did I tell my son to exercise caution while safeguarding his belongings? Nevertheless, we can deduce that he was present here at some point."" She lifted the notebook and gave it a cursory glance, only for another sigh to escape her mouth. Eventually, she extended the notebook towards the adventurers.

""It seems like I'm unable to read its content. It bears an enchantment he used in the past to shield his privacy from his dear mother.""
The adventurers accepted the notebook and looked into its content themselves. It seemed like they had no trouble in reading the written text.",222,"冒险者们偶然发现了一本小笔记本，随意地被遗弃在地板上。封面上潦草地写着“艾伦”的名字。  

马吉卡开始叹气。“我多少次告诉我的儿子在保护自己的物品时要小心？不过，我们可以推测他曾在这里出现过。”她拿起笔记本，随意翻了一下，嘴里又叹了口气。最终，她把笔记本递给了冒险者们。  

“看来我无法阅读其内容。它上面有他过去用来保护隐私不被亲爱的母亲发现的魔法。”  
冒险者们接过笔记本，自己查看其内容。似乎他们在阅读书写的文字时没有任何困难。"

Prior to embarking on this journey, I have made it my foremost task to unearth as many insights I could into this esteemed lineage, lauded in antiquity as the epitome of loyalty to the ancient empire.""

The adventurers stowed the notebook away in their inventory. They had a feeling that the notebook could prove useful.",222,"“随着我即将到来的探险，我正热切准备研究曾属于有影响力的贵族家族赫拉西亚的古老遗迹。在踏上这段旅程之前，我已将挖掘尽可能多的关于这个在古代被誉为对古老帝国忠诚典范的尊贵血统的见解，作为我最重要的任务。”  

冒险者们将笔记本收进了他们的背包。他们感觉这本笔记本可能会派上用场。"
1834454129479682,WORLDEVENT223_PAGE1,"The party came across a lonely house in the woods with an old woman sitting on a bench in front of the house and smoking on a wooden pipe.
She looked at the adventurers and smiled.

""My, my! If it isn't a group of adventurers. I hope you're not here to rob me."" She laughed. ""If you do, then you'll be disappointed to know that there isn't much of value here.""

The group assured her that they were not. ",223,"队伍在森林中遇到了一座孤零零的房子，房子前面坐着一位老奶奶，正在长椅上抽着木烟斗。  
她看着冒险者们，微笑着说。  

“哦，我的天！如果这不是一群冒险者。我希望你们不是来抢我的东西。”她笑着说。“如果你们真来抢，那你们会失望，因为这里没有什么值钱的东西。”  

队伍向她保证他们不是来抢劫的。"

Adventurers used to be so different in my time..."" After a short, uncomfortable silence, she looked back to the group and started to smile again.

""I heard you're supposed to be decent people now. If that's the case I was wondering if you'd be willing to help an old lonely lady like myself? I still have so many chores to do in this house, but my back is feeling especially bad today. I'd be very grateful if you could do them for me and who knows? If you do a good job, I might even have a reward for you in the end.

What do you say?""",223,"“啊，我明白了！你们是来自那个冒险者公会。”老奶奶开始望向远方，似乎在回忆什么。“我还是不习惯。冒险者在我那个时代可大不相同……”经过短暂而尴尬的沉默，她又回头看向队伍，开始再次微笑。  

“我听说你们现在应该是好人。如果是这样，我想知道你们是否愿意帮助像我这样的孤独老太太？我在这个房子里还有很多杂务要做，但我今天的背特别疼。如果你们能帮我做这些，我会非常感激，谁知道呢？如果你们做得好，最后我可能还会给你们准备一个奖励。

Although she sounded disappointed, the group couldn't help but feel that she was quite pleased with the answer. ""Well,  don't let me waste any more of your time. I'm sure you have some important quest you need to do."" With that the group continued their journey and left the strange old woman behind.",223,“我想这也没办法。毕竟有些事情永远不会改变。”老奶奶说道。尽管她听起来很失望，但队伍却觉得她对这个答案相当满意。“好吧，别再浪费你们的时间了。我相信你们有重要的任务要去完成。”说完，队伍继续他们的旅程，留下了这个奇怪的老奶奶。

The Party argued with each other but in the end {CHARACTER1} had no choice but to submit to the will of the party and begrudingly agreed to help. All the while the old woman was just sitting there, listening and smiling.

She started to chuckle. ""Now that you all agreed, I hope you won't start to regret it later.""",223,"队伍同意帮助老奶奶。除了{CHARACTER1}以外。{CHARACTER1}认为帮助这位女士没有任何好处，这只会浪费他们的时间。{GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她}怀疑这位女士只是想要免费的劳动力，而{CHARACTER1}可不想白干活。

她开始轻声笑了起来。“既然你们都同意了，我希望你们以后不会开始后悔。”"
