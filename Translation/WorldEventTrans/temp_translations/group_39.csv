1834453873627140,WORLDEVENT122_PAGE1,"As the group pressed forward, their eyes fell upon something deeply unsettling amidst the snow—a lifeless, abandoned figure. The corpse of an elderly woman lay before them, clad in clothing that hinted at her belonging to a peaceful monastery. It was evident that she was one of the unfortunate souls captured during the jotuns' raid. The harsh march her captors had forced her to endure had proven too much for her frail body.

Upon seeing the lifeless form, the Divine Messenger's expression darkened for the first time the Guild Master has ever seen her. For a moment it seemed like she wanted to say something, but then stopped.",122,"当队伍继续前进时，他们的目光落在雪地中一个令人不安的景象上——一个无生命的、被遗弃的身影。一个年迈女性的尸体躺在他们面前，身穿暗示她属于一个和平修道院的衣物。显然，她是被巨人袭击时不幸被捕的灵魂之一。她的劫持者强迫她忍受的严酷行军对她脆弱的身体来说实在是太过沉重。  

看到这具无生命的身躯，神圣使者的表情第一次显得阴沉，这是公会会长所见过的。她似乎想说些什么，但又停住了。"

1834453873627142,WORLDEVENT122_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE1,"The Guild Master's suggestion to bury the body was met with unanimous agreement. Leaving the deceased woman abandoned in the snow without a proper burial felt wrong to each member of the group. She had already endured a harrowing journey far away from her home, and the least they could do for her was to lay her to rest with dignity.

They gathered what materials they could find to fashion a makeshift grave and gently lowered the woman into her final resting place. As they stood around the grave, they offered a prayer for the departed soul. During the prayer, the Guild Master noticed a faint whisper from the Divine Messenger's direction. Her words were almost imperceptible but carried a profound weight: ""Forgive me,...""

Once the burial rites were completed, they continued their march.",122,"公会会长提议埋葬尸体，得到了全体成员的一致同意。将死去的女性遗弃在雪地中而不进行适当的葬礼，对每个队员来说都感觉不对。她已经经历了远离家乡的艰难旅程，他们能为她做的最起码的事情就是以尊严安葬她。  

他们收集了能找到的材料，制作了一个简易的坟墓，并小心翼翼地将女性放入她的最后安息之地。当他们围绕坟墓站立时，向逝去的灵魂祈祷。在祈祷期间，公会会长注意到神圣使者方向传来微弱的低语。她的话几乎听不见，但却蕴含着深刻的分量：“原谅我，……”  

一旦葬礼仪式完成，他们继续前行。"

However, as the group was about to move on, the Guild Master realized that someone was still not moving. To their surprise it was the Divine Messenger, who kept silently staring at the corpse. When she realized that the others were waiting for her, she put up another smile and apologized for her tardiness.

With that the group finally left the body behind.",122,"尽管眼前的景象令人沮丧，公会会长还是鼓励队伍继续前进，强调拯救仍然活着的俘虏的重要性。冒险者们虽然不情愿，但还是跟了上去。  

然而，当队伍准备继续前进时，公会会长意识到还有人没有动。令他们惊讶的是，竟然是神圣使者，她默默地盯着尸体。当她意识到其他人在等她时，她露出了另一个微笑，并为自己的迟到道歉。  

就这样，队伍终于将尸体抛在了身后。"

""During my recent research endeavors, I have acquired substantial knowledge concerning the ancestral lineage of the illustrious Herathia family. Among the wealth of information, one aspect captured my attention. It was their unwavering devotion to the seven gods—an esteemed practice that in stark contrast with our present times, waned in the later period of the ancient empire's era. Nonetheless, the Herathia family stood as a rare exception, upholding this sacred tradition with steadfast dedication. So profound was their faith that they even etched their unique rendition of the creation narrative within the hallowed walls of their ancestral abode. I have transcribed this chronicle and preserved it within these pages in the prospect that this narrative may bear relevance to our upcoming undertakings.""",123,"冒险者们翻阅笔记，寻找与谜语相关的线索。他们发现了一段引起他们注意的文字：  

“在我最近的研究中，我获得了关于赫拉西亚家族显赫血统的丰富知识。在众多信息中，有一方面引起了我的注意。那就是他们对七位神明的坚定信仰——这一崇高的做法与我们现在的时代形成鲜明对比，在古代帝国后期逐渐衰退。然而，赫拉西亚家族却是一个罕见的例外，以坚定的信念维护这一神圣的传统。他们的信仰如此深厚，以至于甚至在他们祖传的住所的神圣墙壁上刻下了自己独特的创造叙事。我已将这一记载抄录并保存在这些页面中，希望这一叙事能与我们即将进行的任务相关。”"

As the light touched the door, sparks flew as if some form of resistance tried to block Majika's spell. However, it was futile. The magic that once filled the stone door started to drain until it was finally gone.
