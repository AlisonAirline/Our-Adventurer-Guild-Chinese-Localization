1834453613580295,WORLDEVENT3_PAGE1,"The adventurers arrived at the Arena in Cragmond, where a throng of spectators had already gathered at the arena's tribunes, even though the tournament had not yet begun. These early arrivals came solely to observe the contestants before the rest of the crowd poured in.

In the arena, several parties of men and women had already assembled. Most of them were adventurers much like themselves, however with the key difference that they were unaffiliated with the Guild. Many of them either mingled with others, boasting and bragging about their prowess or distanced themselves from their peers to conceal their true capabilities. Among these groups, one party stood out from the rest. Their equipment gleamed with the highest quality that money could buy, matched only by the radiant confidence they exuded—a confidence that could only be acquired through years of battle-hardened experience. It was evident to the adventurers that these individuals were Falken's former comrades.",3,"冒险者们抵达了克拉格蒙德的竞技场，尽管比赛尚未开始，但已经有一群观众在竞技场的看台上聚集。这些提前到达的人仅仅是为了在其他观众涌入之前观察参赛者。  

在竞技场中，几组男女已经聚集在一起。他们大多数都是和他们一样的冒险者，但有一个关键的区别，那就是他们与公会没有任何关系。许多人要么与他人交谈，夸耀自己的能力，要么与同伴保持距离，以隐藏自己的真实实力。在这些群体中，有一组显得格外突出。他们的装备闪烁着金钱所能购买的最高品质，只有他们散发出的自信与之相匹配——这种自信只能通过多年的战斗经验获得。冒险者们很明显地意识到，这些人是法尔肯的前战友。"
1834453617774592,WORLDEVENT3RESULT0_PAGE1,"Suddenly, a man in resplendent attire called out, his commanding voice echoing through the arena. With a graceful sweep of his hand, he introduced himself as the master of the arena and extended his gratitude to the contestants for their journey to participate in the grand tournament. With a glint of excitement in his eyes, he continued to explain that before the grand tournament could begin, every party would need to prove themselves in a series of challenges. Only those with the highest scores would earn the honor to compete in the arena.

""Get ready for the ultimate test of Strength, Dexterity, and Willpower!' he declared, a spark of anticipation in his voice. ""Only the best amongst you will earn the right to fight in our arena!'""
",3,"突然，一个身着华丽服装的男子高声叫道，他的威严声音在竞技场中回荡。他优雅地挥动手臂，自我介绍为竞技场的主人，并对参赛者们的到来表示感谢，感谢他们参与这场盛大的比赛。他眼中闪烁着兴奋的光芒，继续解释道，在盛大比赛开始之前，每个团队都需要在一系列挑战中证明自己。只有得分最高的团队才能获得在竞技场竞争的荣誉。  

“准备好迎接力量、灵巧和意志力的终极考验吧！”他宣告道，声音中带着期待的火花。“只有你们中最优秀的人才能获得在我们竞技场战斗的权利！”"
1834453617774593,WORLDEVENT4_PAGE1,"The Party found the Adventurer Daryl the Village elder was talking about. Judging from his equipment it seemed like he was somebody who favored the bow as his weapon of choice.

The young man was currently breaking up his camp. It was clear that he was about to leave the village.",4,"队伍找到了村长达里尔所提到的冒险者。从他的装备来看，他似乎是一个偏爱弓箭作为武器的人。  

这个年轻人正忙着收拾他的营地。显然，他即将离开村庄。"

I have no intention to throw my life away."" ",4,"“我想你们就是村民雇来保护他们的公会冒险者。”他在看到队伍后说道。“我大概知道你们来这里的原因，所以让我节省我们双方的时间，给你们一个我对村民们说过的答案：  

我没有打算把我的生命抛弃。”"

""A word of advice: Just leave and tell the villagers to do the same; maybe they'll listen to you. This village was already doomed the moment the bandit king's men showed up.""",4,"他收拾完营地，把一个旅行包扔在肩上。  
“给你们一句建议：离开吧，告诉村民们也这样做；也许他们会听你们的。这个村庄在强盗王的手下早已注定要毁灭。”"

He pointed at his bow: ""I'm a pretty good shot and do know the nearby forest like the back of my hand.

I might be able to delay some of the bandits so you don't have to deal with too many of them at the same time. But don't expect anything more than that.""

",4,"“……我承认，如果我至少做点什么，我会睡得更安稳。虽然我怀疑这会有什么用。”  

他指着自己的弓：“我射得不错，对附近的森林了如指掌。

Suprised Daryl asked back: ""Fine with what?""

""Just living a life for the sake of surviving? Didn't you become an adventurer to make something of your life?""

Daryl sighed. ""Don't tell me you're one of those kind of adventurers? Kid, we're not heroes. You've just listened to too many stories from drunken adventurers in a tavern, who wanted to make themselves bigger then they are.

However, the truth is that we aren't. Do you really think I'm an adventurer because I want to? I'm basically just a vagabond.""",4,"艾兰向前一步，问达里尔：“你真的对此感到满意吗？”  

惊讶的达里尔反问：“满意什么？”  

“仅仅为了生存而生活？难道你成为冒险者不是为了让自己的生活有所成就吗？”  

达里尔叹了口气。“别告诉我你是那种冒险者？小子，我们可不是英雄。你只是听了太多醉酒冒险者在酒馆里讲的故事，他们想让自己显得更伟大。  

然而，真相是我们并不是。你真的认为我成为冒险者是因为我想吗？我基本上只是个流浪汉。”"

""I nearly died alone in a cave after being ambushed by monsters in a quest where I only had to pick up some herbs. The thing that scared me the most of at that time, wasn't death itself. It was the fact that if I had died in that moment, then my life would have amounted to nothing.""

Elan looked at Daryl: ""If you run away now then sure, you will survive today. If you keep running from one place to another you might even survive much longer.

But at some point you will die and then you will die with nothing to your name."" 

Daryl looked uncomfortable. He clearly did not like that prospect.",4,"<b>“但你难道不想成为更多吗？”</b> 艾兰大声喊道，令所有人都感到惊讶。艾兰通常不是那种会提高声音的人。  

“我在一个任务中，独自一人被怪物伏击，几乎死在一个只需采集一些草药的洞穴里。那时我最害怕的并不是死亡本身，而是如果我在那一刻死去，我的生命将毫无意义。”  

艾兰看着达里尔：“如果你现在逃跑，那你今天当然能活下来。如果你不断从一个地方逃到另一个地方，你甚至可能活得更久。  

但总有一天你会死，然后你将一无所有。”  

达里尔显得不安。他显然不喜欢这个前景。"

Daryl thought about it for a while.

""I guess you're not wrong."" he finally said. ""We'll all die someday anyway. So why not while doing something worth remembering?""

He extended his hand and for the first time since they met him he smiled.
""I'll help you fight.""",4,"“或者……”艾兰继续说道，“……你可以帮助我们保护这些人，哪怕在你生命中的某一刻感受到英雄的感觉。”  

达里尔思考了一会儿。  

“我想你说得没错。”他终于说道。“反正我们总会死的。那么为什么不在做一些值得铭记的事情时死去呢？”  

他伸出手，第一次露出了微笑。“我会帮助你们战斗。”"
