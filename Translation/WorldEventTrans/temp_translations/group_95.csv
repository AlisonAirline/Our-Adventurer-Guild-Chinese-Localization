""Guild Master! I've just made a new batch of potions for everyone, and here are some I saved for you,"" she said, handing them to the adventurers.

Afterwards, her face carried a worried expression when she asked, ""Is it true? They say that there will be a final assault.""",295,"当公会会长和冒险者们巡视时，艾米莉走上前，怀里抱着几瓶药水。  

“公会会长！我刚刚为大家制作了一批新的药水，这里有一些是我为您留的，”她说着，把药水递给冒险者们。  

随后，她的脸上露出了担忧的神情，问道：“是真的吗？他们说会有最后的攻击。”"

""D-do you think you can win?"" she asked nervously. 

The Guild Master smiled slightly and patted her head.
 

""I don't know, but if things turn south, try to escape. Try asking Me'can. If it's him, I'm sure he's able to get both of you out of here somehow."" Emily tried to protest, but the Guild Master cut her off. 

""No backtalk, young lady!"" A sad look was on Emily's face, but in the end, she nodded.",295,"“看起来是的。是的，”公会会长回答。  

“你觉得你们能赢吗？”她紧张地问。  

公会会长微微一笑，轻拍了她的头。  

“我不知道，但如果情况变糟，尽量逃跑。试着问问梅坎。如果是他，我相信他能以某种方式把你们两个带出去。”艾米莉试图反驳，但公会会长打断了她。  

“不要顶嘴，小姑娘！”艾米莉脸上流露出悲伤的神情，但最终她点了点头。"
1834454305640452,WORLDEVENT296_PAGE1,"The day had finally arrived. As the Guild Master surveyed the landscape from atop the walls, they could see an overwhelming mass of enemies closing in on the Guild. Their numbers surpassed the Guild Master's expectations, and the adventurers accompanying the Guild shared the sentiment, evident in their pale expressions. The approaching army, being comprised of a diverse mix of cultists, bandits, lephoz, jotuns, and even demons, started to form an encirclement around the Adventurer Guild, leaving no room for escape.

Fortunately, the Guild was once an ancient military fortress, strategically positioned in a nearly impregnable location. Seeing that the enemy lacked any form of siege equipment, the Guild Master was confident that, even with the limited number of adventurers, they could withstand the assault for a considerable time. However, they had to ask themself: For how long?",296,"这一天终于到来了。当公会会长从城墙上俯瞰风景时，他们看到一大群敌人正逼近公会。敌人的数量超出了公会会长的预期，陪伴公会的冒险者们也感同身受，脸色苍白。逼近的军队由各种各样的邪教徒、强盗、雷佛兹、巨人，甚至恶魔组成，开始围住冒险者公会，毫无逃脱的余地。  

幸运的是，公会曾经是一个古老的军事堡垒，战略位置几乎不可攻破。看到敌人没有任何攻城器械，公会会长对即使在冒险者人数有限的情况下，他们也能抵挡攻击一段时间充满信心。然而，他们不得不问自己：能撑多久呢？"

Suddenly, a noise near the door roused them. Initially dismissing it, they soon realized the door was opening. As they stood up, a novice adventurer entered, seemingly normal at first. However, the glint in their eyes and the dagger in their hands revealed their hostile intent.
",297,"公会会长难以入睡。有太多问题需要解决，让他们无法安宁。  

突然，门口传来一阵声音将他们惊醒。起初他们对此不以为然，但很快意识到门正在打开。当他们站起身时，一个初级冒险者走了进来，起初看起来很正常。然而，眼中的光芒和手中的匕首暴露了他们的敌意。"
1834454309834752,WORLDEVENT297RESULT0_PAGE1,"Swiftly, the adventurer attacked, pushing the Guild Master to the ground. With a crazed determination, the assailant aimed to drive the dagger into the Guild Master's chest. Desperate, the Guild Master tried to resist, but the situation was dire.

Just as the dagger threatened to pierce their skin, a second person entered the room and rammed the assailant away with their body. It was {CHARACTER1}! The assailant, thrown off, hit their head at the wall and fell unconscious. {CHARACTER1} quickly explained that several novice adventurers had turned hostile and attacked the gate guards. ",297,"冒险者迅速发动攻击，将公会会长推倒在地。带着疯狂的决心，袭击者试图将匕首刺入公会会长的胸膛。绝望中，公会会长试图抵抗，但形势危急。

Understanding that this demon could seemingly manipulate adventurers, it became clear how it could hide itself for so long and how they could so easily identify and destroy the supply store. Now it has gathered enough thralls to attempt an attack on the gates.

The rest of {CHARACTER1}'s party soon arrived. Realizing the urgency, the Guild Master instructed {CHARACTER1}'s party to deal with the demon. Acknowledging the severity of the situation, the adventurers nodded and immediately engaged in battle with the demon and their former allies.",297,"没有浪费时间，他们急忙朝大门赶去，发现一只带翅膀的女性恶魔被一群被迷惑的初级冒险者包围。意识到这个恶魔似乎能够操控冒险者，显然它能够隐藏这么久，并且轻易识别和摧毁补给库。现在它已经聚集了足够的追随者，准备对大门发起攻击。  

{CHARACTER1}的其他队员很快赶到。意识到事态的紧急性，公会会长指示{CHARACTER1}的队伍处理恶魔。冒险者们意识到情况的严重性，点头同意，立刻与恶魔及他们曾经的盟友展开战斗。"
