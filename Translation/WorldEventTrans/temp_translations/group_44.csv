1834453928153092,WORLDEVENT137_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE1,"The young girl, who remarkably resembled the Divine Messenger and who had been nearly sacrificed, clung to the Divine Messenger, weeping and thanking her the whole time. The Divine Messenger hugged her back, tightly.

The Guild Master started to observe the aftermath of the battle. It was a bloody battle and all the jotuns and as well the cultists were killed. Or so they thought until they saw a faint movement amongst the bodies. To their surprise, one of the cultists still clung to life, trying to crawl away in a desperate bid for survival.",137,"那个年轻女孩，令人惊讶地与神使极为相似，几乎被牺牲，她紧紧依偎在神使身边，哭泣着不停感谢她。神使也紧紧拥抱着她。

公会会长开始观察战斗的后果。这是一场血腥的战斗，所有的巨人和邪教徒都被杀死了。或者说，他们原本是这么认为的，直到他们看到尸体中有微弱的动静。令他们惊讶的是，其中一个邪教徒仍然顽强地活着，试图在绝望中爬走。"
1834453928153093,WORLDEVENT137_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE2,"An adventurer moved in to put an end to the cultist, but the Divine Messenger's bodyguard stepped in between. ""Not him,"" the Divine Messenger stated. The bodyguard then knocked the cultist unconscious and carried the unconscious body on his shoulder.

""Was this the actual reason we pursued them?"" the Guild Master asked, their voice carrying a dry tone. The Divine Messenger didn't answer but her silence told them everything they needed to know.

Preparations were made to leave. They were unsucessful in saving most of the captives and only one girl managed to survive.
A girl, whom the Guild Master was sure was used as bait.",137,"一名冒险者向前走去准备结束这个邪教徒，但神使的保镖站在了中间。“不是他，”神使说道。保镖随即将邪教徒击昏，并将昏迷的身体扛在肩上。

“这真的是我们追捕他们的原因吗？”公会会长问，声音中带着干涩的语气。神使没有回答，但她的沉默告诉他们一切。

准备离开。他们未能成功救下大多数人质，只有一个女孩活了下来。  
这个女孩，公会会长确信是被用作诱饵的。"
1834453928153094,WORLDEVENT137_DECISION2,"Unfortunately, the sacrifice didn't make it.",137,不幸的是，牺牲品没有活下来。
1834453932347392,WORLDEVENT137_DECISION2RESULT0_PAGE1,"The Divine Messenger stood at the place where the young girl, who resembled her, has been sacrificed, leaving only a trail of her blood on the ground. The Guild Master couldn't see the expression on her face and wondered what she might be thinking.

The Guild Master left her alone and started to observe the aftermath of the battle. It was a bloody battle and all the jotuns and as well the cultists were killed...Or so they thought until they saw a faint movement amongst the bodies. 
To their surprise, one of the cultists still clung to life, trying to crawl away in a desperate bid for survival.",137,"神使站在那个年轻女孩被牺牲的地方，地上只留下她的血迹。公会会长看不清她脸上的表情，心中猜测她在想什么。

公会会长将她留在一旁，开始观察战斗的后果。这是一场血腥的战斗，所有的巨人和邪教徒都被杀死了……或者说，他们原本是这么认为的，直到他们看到尸体中有微弱的动静。  
令他们惊讶的是，其中一个邪教徒仍然顽强地活着，试图在绝望中爬走。"

Preparations were made to leave. Looking at the outcome one would think that their quest has ended in utter failure. After all, they didn't manage to save a single captive. However, looking at the Divine Messenger's bodyguard carrying an unconcious cultist, it became clear that another objective has been accomplished. And maybe...it was the main objective all along.",137,"一名冒险者向前走去准备结束这个邪教徒，但神使的保镖站在了中间。“不是他，”神使说道。保镖随即将邪教徒击昏，并将昏迷的身体扛在肩上。

“这真的是我们追捕他们的原因吗？”公会会长问，声音中带着干涩的语气。神使没有反应。

准备离开。看着结果，人们会认为他们的任务以彻底失败告终。毕竟，他们没有成功救下一个人质。然而，看到神使的保镖扛着一个昏迷的邪教徒，显然另一个目标已经达成。也许……这一直是主要目标。"
1834453932347394,WORLDEVENT138_PAGE1,"After entering through the last door the adventurers were suddenly greeted by a loud scream directed at them.
""Don't let the ***** door close!"" someone shouted at them. Looking for the source of the voice the adventurer spotted a young woman, who resembled a priestess, taking care of several people lying on the floor. Many of them appeared malnourished. 
The priestess herself didn't look like she was much better off but apparently she still had the energy to shout obscenities.

""Yes! ****, yes! We're saved! ***** saved!""",138,"在穿过最后一扇门后，冒险者们突然听到一声大喊。“不要让*****门关上！”有人朝他们喊道。寻找声音的来源，冒险者发现一位年轻女子，像个女祭司一样，正在照顾躺在地上的几个人。他们中的许多人看起来营养不良。  
女祭司本人看起来也没好到哪里去，但显然她仍然有力气大喊粗口。

“是的！****，是的！我们得救了！*****得救了！”"
1834453932347395,WORLDEVENT138_PAGE2,"Without a word, Majika moved forward towards one of the people lying on the floor. She sat next to the person and carefully placed his head on her lap. The young man opened his eyes and with little strength in his voice, he uttered: ""...Mother?""

She looked at him with an expression the adventurers had never seen on her before.",138,"没有说话，Majika向躺在地上的一个人走去。她坐在那人旁边，小心翼翼地将他的头放在自己的腿上。年轻男子睁开眼睛，微弱地说道：“……母亲？”

她用冒险者们从未见过的表情看着他。"
1834453932347396,WORLDEVENT139_PAGE1,"In a dire and unexpected situation, the adventurers found themselves surrounded by a combination of cultists and Lephoz warriors, while searching for the Witch's Disciple. With archers positioned strategically atop cliffs, they were trapped in a precarious predicament.

""Did you honestly believe your snooping would go unnoticed?"" a woman in the distance taunted. She was clearly the target of their quest. ""This will be your ultimate mistake.""

She snapped her fingers, and the archers unleashed a storm of arrows upon the adventurers.",139,"在一个严峻而意想不到的情况下，冒险者们在寻找女巫的弟子时，发现自己被邪教徒和莱佛兹战士包围。弓箭手们在悬崖上战略性地布置，他们陷入了一个危险的境地。

“你们真的以为你们的窥探会不被注意吗？”远处的一个女人嘲讽道。她显然是他们任务的目标。“这将是你们的致命错误。”

她打了个响指，弓箭手们向冒险者们发射了一阵箭雨。"
