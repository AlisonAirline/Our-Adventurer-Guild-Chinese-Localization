1834454062370819,WORLDEVENT193_PAGE1,"Just as they've been told. the adventurers have reached the location where the ghost's influence appears to be most potent. An unmistakable chill permeated the air, a sensation not entirely accountable to the tundra's cold temperatures. An aura of foreboding gripped the adventurers as they surveyed the area. Nevertheless, they pressed forward, determined to uncover the source of the deadly incidents.",193,就如他们所被告知的那样，冒险者们到达了幽灵影响力最强的地点。空气中弥漫着无法忽视的寒意，这种感觉并不完全归因于冰原的低温。冒险者们在观察周围时，感受到了一种不祥的气息。然而，他们依然坚定地向前迈进，决心揭开致命事件的源头。
1834454062370820,WORLDEVENT194_PAGE1,"The adventurers reached the heart of a village laid to waste. Ruined structures littered the landscape, and the remains of long-forgotten souls lay strewn about, as though casualties of some ominous assault.

Their attention was captivated by a singular skeleton that seemed to draw them in. As they approached, a sense of foreboding settled upon them, intensifying with each step, until the scene around them seemed to shift.

<i>It was a day filled with radiant joy, perhaps the most beautiful day of your life, reserved only for your wedding. The village had gathered, a tight-knit community that knew one another intimately. A small village, where every name was familiar and everyone had a place in your heart. Faces both old and young radiated happiness as you passed, blessings and well-wishes flowing like a river. Gazing at you with adoration, older villagers offered congratulations, young girls envisioned their own futures, and children observed you with wide, curious eyes.

他们的注意力被一具独特的骷髅所吸引，似乎在召唤他们。随着他们的靠近，一种不祥的预感笼罩在他们心头，随着每一步的靠近愈发强烈，直到周围的场景似乎开始扭曲。  

<i>那是一个充满光辉喜悦的日子，也许是你一生中最美好的一天，仅为你的婚礼而留。村庄里的人们聚集在一起，紧密团结的社区彼此熟悉。一个小村庄，每个名字都耳熟能详，每个人在你心中都有一席之地。无论是年长者还是年轻人，脸上都洋溢着幸福的笑容，当你经过时，祝福和良好的祝愿如河流般涌来。年长的村民们满怀崇敬地注视着你，送上祝贺，年轻女孩们憧憬着自己的未来，孩子们则用好奇的目光注视着你。"

Though he had a stern look on his face, you recognized the genuine happiness he felt for you. As you approached your future husband, your father relinquished your hand, punctuating the moment with a strict glance that drew out a gulp from your betrothed. You couldn't help but giggle—time hadn't dulled his fear of his future father-in-law. Satisfied with the effect he'd achieved, your father joined your tearful mother nearby.

""Your white dress suits you beautifully,"" the love of your life murmured, a radiant smile gracing his lips. His eyes met yours, and your own smile emerged, a reflection of your happiness. You remembered how some of the other girls had once described his appearance as unremarkable, but you ardently disagreed. ""You're handsome too!"" you playfully retorted.

“你的白色婚纱真美，”你生命中的挚爱轻声说道，脸上洋溢着灿烂的微笑。他的眼睛与你相遇，你的微笑也随之绽放，映照出你的幸福。你记得其他女孩曾经形容他的外貌平凡，但你坚决不同意。“你也很帅！”你调皮地反驳道。"

When he inquired whether you both pledged to remain together until death parted you, your affirmative responses flowed without hesitation.

""With the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife! You may kiss the bride,"" the village elder announced. Jubilant cheers erupted from the attendees.

With a tenderness that bespoke his affection, your husband lifted your veil, and his hands cupped your face. As his face drew near, his lips met yours. It wasn't the first time you shared a kiss but it was the sweetest one you've experienced. It was a moment brimming with unparalleled happiness.

From the shadows emerged a horde of monstrous blue-skinned giants, wielding axes and torches. Lost in the euphoria of your own wedding, the unfolding chaos bewildered your senses until the first villager fell, struck down by a marauding invader. Blood tainted the air, and screams pierced the serenity. The world shifted on its axis—houses became infernos, smiles contorted into masks of terror.

",194,"<i>然而，这份喜悦很快被刺骨的战吼所淹没。  

从阴影中涌现出一群蓝皮肤的巨人，手持斧头和火把。沉浸在自己婚礼的狂欢中，眼前的混乱让你感到困惑，直到第一个村民被侵略者击倒，鲜血染红了空气，尖叫声刺破了宁静。世界在其轴心上剧烈扭转——房屋化为火海，笑容扭曲成恐惧的面具。"
