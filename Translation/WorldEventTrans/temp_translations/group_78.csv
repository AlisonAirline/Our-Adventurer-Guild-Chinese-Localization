Amongst them were not only the corpses of undead which have been forcefully put back to death but also the corpses of people who seemed to have been alive not too long ago. When the party asked the man what has transpired, he answered solemnly ""Those were my comrades. We were adventurers just like you and here because of a contract. Got ambushed by the dead. Now they're all dead.""

They asked him why he is still here.

他们问他为什么还在这里。

“不能把他们留在这里。”他低声说道。现在显而易见，这个男人打算和他的战友一起死在这里。"
