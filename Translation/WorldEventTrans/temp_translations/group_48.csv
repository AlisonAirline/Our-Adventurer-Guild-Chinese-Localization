Whoever put on the tent clearly had no time to break camp in an orderly fashion and had to leave their belongings behind.

When the group entered it, they were greeted by an abundance of rare herbs, flasks, mortars and pestle and anything else that would be required to mix potions. It was evident that whoever lived here before was an alchemist.  

But considering the run-down state of the shack the previous owner either died or abandoned the shack a long time ago.
In one corner of the house there was a chest that caught the attention of the group. It clearly looked like it held something of value. But the glowing runes on the lock clearly stated that a poor handling could have dangerous results.",151,"队伍发现了一个似乎被遗弃的小棚屋。
