1834454439858178,WORLDEVENT343_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE1,"Most of the papers lying around seemed to be describing the operations of the cult as a whole. Describing plans that were in the making or have already been completed. What caught their attention was the fact that many of the operations were associated with estimated numbers and everytime one of the operations seems to be completed another number got reduced by it. After looking through all the plans they realized that the operations' goal was to reduce a certain number, for what reason they did not know. But the lowest the number has gotten seems to indicate that the cult wouldn't need much longer to reduce it to zero.

Continuing to go through the papers the adventurers found two more things of note. A notebook and a group of paper what seems to be the copy of a contract littered with notes.",343,"桌子上大部分的纸张似乎在描述这个邪教整体的运作。描述了正在制定或已经完成的计划。引起他们注意的是，许多操作都与估算数字相关，每当一项操作似乎完成时，另一个数字就会减少。经过查看所有的计划，他们意识到这些操作的目标是减少某个特定的数字，出于什么原因他们并不知道。但这个数字降低到的最低点似乎表明，邪教不需要太长时间就能将其减少到零。

继续翻阅这些文件，冒险者们发现了另外两样值得注意的东西：一本笔记本和一组似乎是合同副本的纸张，上面布满了笔记。"

Although the text remained intentionally convoluted, after a more meticulous read, {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} realized that it had been carefully crafted to eliminate any legal loopholes for either party. Extensive notes and comments, presumably added by the witch, seemed designed to fortify the contract, ensuring that it left the demon lords with only the intended interpretation.
 
And it didn't take long for {CHARACTER1} to grasp the essence of the deal.

It was an exchange.

It promised an astronomical quantity of souls to the demon lords in return for the rebirth of a single soul held in their possession, ambiguously referred to as the ""main contract holder."" Intriguingly, an addendum restricted the demon lords' influence over the witch. Although laden with complex conditions, the addendum essentially prevented the demon lords from monitoring the witch's actions.

A question began to gnaw at {CHARACTER1}'s mind: Did the witch have secrets she withheld even from her patrons, the demon lords?

而且，{CHARACTER1}很快就抓住了交易的本质。

这是一种交换。

它承诺向恶魔领主提供大量灵魂，以换取一具被他们掌握的单一灵魂的重生，模糊地称之为“主要合同持有者”。有趣的是，附录限制了恶魔领主对女巫的影响。尽管附录中充满了复杂的条件，但本质上防止了恶魔领主监视女巫的行为。
