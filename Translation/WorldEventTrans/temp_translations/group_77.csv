1834454192394240,WORLDEVENT240_PAGE1,"The party spots a dark-robed figure carrying a corpse with him.

Curious about who the figure might be and what he was doing, they started to observe him from a safe distance. The robed figure carried the corpse to a spot where a red pentagram was crudely drawn on the stone floor. He placed the corpse on the pentagram and took out a black book. From a distance, the party could tell that the book looked ancient, and even those without arcane knowledge could feel that there was some dark power behind it. The figure opened the book and, after reading it for a moment, began to chant something that sounded like a spell.",240,"队伍发现一个身穿黑袍的身影，正携带着一具尸体。  

出于好奇，他们想知道这个身影是谁以及他在做什么，于是开始从安全的距离观察他。这个黑袍人将尸体带到一个在石地上粗糙画出的红色五角星上。他把尸体放在五角星上，拿出一本黑色的书。从远处看，队伍可以判断这本书看起来非常古老，甚至那些没有奥术知识的人也能感受到书中蕴含着某种黑暗力量。这个身影打开书本，读了一会儿后，开始念出听起来像咒语的东西。"
1834454192394241,WORLDEVENT240_PAGE2,"Nothing happened.

Everyone in the party expected the corpse to rise up, but instead, it still lay motionless on the ground. This wasn't the result they were expecting, and it seems neither did the robed figure, who started to curse and flip the pages of the book.",240,"什么也没有发生。  

队伍中的每个人都期待尸体会复活，但它却仍然静静地躺在地上。这不是他们所期待的结果，似乎黑袍人也没有料到，开始咒骂并翻动书页。"

1834454192394243,WORLDEVENT240_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE1,"The party decided they would confront the hooded figure. It was likely that they were attempting necromancy, and if they were, the party had to intervene. They began to approach the hooded figure, who initially did not notice their presence. It was only when they were at sprinting distance that the hooded figure finally realized they were not alone. Upon noticing them, the robed person started to scream and attempted to run away. However, not paying attention, they stumbled over the corpse they had been carrying and fell down. Probably sensing that they had missed their chance to escape, the hooded figure started to yell, 'PLEASE! DON'T HURT ME! LET'S TALK!",240,队伍决定 confront 黑袍人。他们很可能在尝试死灵法术，如果是这样，队伍必须介入。他们开始接近黑袍人，最初他并没有注意到他们的存在。直到他们接近到可以冲刺的距离，黑袍人才终于意识到他们并不孤单。注意到他们后，黑袍人开始尖叫并试图逃跑。然而，因不注意，他绊倒在自己携带的尸体上，摔倒在地。可能意识到自己错过了逃跑的机会，黑袍人开始大喊：“请！不要伤害我！我们可以谈谈！”

Curious about the necromancer {CHARACTER1} rolled the figure over. {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} eyes widened in surprise when {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} saw their face.

1834454196588547,WORLDEVENT241_PAGE1,"The Party finally got a good look at the hooded figure. It was a young girl. Hardly old enough to be considered an adult. ""T-this isn't what it looks like. I-I -I..."" she stammered. It seemed like she couldn't figure out a response that could in any way explain her behaviour other than what they all were already thinking. She started sobbing ""Please, don't hurt me!"" Necromancy was a heavy crime, for which the lightest punishment would be death. It seems like the girl realized that and was afraid of the consequences of her action.

""I will never do it again! Please just let me go!"" she begged. ""You can even have the book. Even if it's not a real magic book it's surely worth something!"". When asked where she got the book, she answered: ""S-some man gave it to me. He said it would give me power but now I know he was just lying."" ",241,"队伍终于看清了黑袍人。她是一个年轻女孩，几乎还不够被认为是成年人。“这……不是你们想的那样。我……我……”她结结巴巴地说。看来她无法想出任何能解释她行为的回应，除了他们所想的那样。她开始哭泣：“请，不要伤害我！”死灵法术是一项重罪，最轻的惩罚就是死刑。看来这个女孩意识到了这一点，并且害怕自己行为的后果。  

“我再也不会这样做了！请放我走！”她恳求道。“你们甚至可以拿走这本书。即使这不是一本真正的魔法书，它肯定也值点钱！”当被问到她从哪里得到这本书时，她回答：“有个男人给我的。他说这会给我力量，但现在我知道他只是撒谎。”"
1834454196588548,WORLDEVENT241_PAGE2,The Party looked at the book that was lying on the floor after the girl has dropped it. They were sure that the book had some sort of power and it was only because of the girl's inability to use it that it appears to be a normal book. But something about the book made the Party feel uneasy. It surely would be a powerful book to have but it was a book about necromancy. There are many stories about the dangers of having a grimoire of a necromancer. Should they really use it?,241,队伍看着掉在地上的书，正是女孩掉下的。他们确信这本书有某种力量，正是因为女孩无法使用它，它才看起来像一本普通的书。但这本书的某些东西让队伍感到不安。这肯定是一本强大的书，但它是一本关于死灵法术的书。关于拥有死灵法师的魔法书的危险有很多故事。他们真的应该使用它吗？
