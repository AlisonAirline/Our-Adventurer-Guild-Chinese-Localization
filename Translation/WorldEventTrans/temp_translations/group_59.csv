As they stood there, tears started to flow down their cheeks. The scene around them shifted once more.

<i>You found yourself leaning against a tree, the weight of escape bearing down on you. You remember as your husband threw himself against one of those blue-skinned giants. He was so much smaller than his adversary and yet he managed to keep him at bay. You remember the words he shouted at you. ""Flee! I will soon come after!"" he told you. You knew it was a lie. You always knew when he was lying. Still, you obeyed, fleeing with all your strength. Running until your surroundings became unfamiliar to you. But did it really matter where you were heading?

当他们站在那里，泪水开始顺着脸颊流下。周围的场景再次发生了变化。  

<i>你发现自己靠在一棵树上，逃离的重担压在心头。你记得你的丈夫曾向那些蓝皮肤的巨人冲去。他比对手小得多，却仍然设法将其挡住。你记得他对你喊出的那些话。“逃吧！我很快就会追上！”他告诉你。你知道那是谎言。你总是能分辨出他在撒谎。尽管如此，你还是服从了，拼尽全力逃跑。奔跑直到周围的景象变得陌生。但你真的在意自己要去哪里吗？"

It started snowing. ""Winter's not far off now,"" you mused absentmindedly.

Snow draped over your form, chilling your body. Your mind told you that you need to move to live. Yet, even in this numbed state, the will to survive dissolved into nothing. You allowed it to happen.

As the cold tightened its grip and your vision blurred, your final thoughts reached out to your family and those you held dear. Were they waiting in the afterlife? Would you reunite with them? An embrace of tranquility enfolded you, your eyes fluttering shut as the embers of life dwindled. Sensation diminished—one layer at a time.

开始下雪了。“冬天不远了，”你心不在焉地想着。  

雪花覆盖在你的身上，令你感到寒冷。你的脑海告诉你必须动起来才能活下去。然而，即使在这种麻木的状态下，生存的意志也渐渐消散。你任由这一切发生。  

随着寒冷的加剧和视线的模糊，你最后的思绪向你的家人和你所珍爱的人伸出。她们在来世等着你吗？你会和她们重聚吗？一阵宁静的拥抱包围了你，随着生命的余烬渐渐熄灭，你的眼睛缓缓闭上。感觉逐渐减弱——一层又一层。"
