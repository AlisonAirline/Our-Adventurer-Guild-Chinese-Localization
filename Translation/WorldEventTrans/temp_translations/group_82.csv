Those who managed to survive the onslaught quickly scattered in fear, and it was clear that the goblins would be unable to amass such a sizable force again. The witch's disciple fought until her last breath, her lifeless body now lying among the fallen on the battlefield. With the enemy vanquished, the adventurers had no choice but to collect the woman's belongings and return them to the Guild, in the hope of finding a clue that would lead them to the witch.",255,哥布林和邪教徒的联合力量根本无法与冒险者抗衡。那些幸存下来的人迅速因恐惧而四散而逃，很明显，哥布林再也无法聚集如此庞大的力量。女巫的弟子拼尽最后一口气战斗，现如今她的无生命的身体躺在战场上众多倒下者之中。敌人被击退后，冒险者们别无选择，只能收集这名女子的遗物，并将其带回公会，希望能找到能够引导他们找到女巫的线索。
1834454230142980,WORLDEVENT256_PAGE1,"As the group pressed on, they stumbled upon something buried in the snow—an intricately ornate amulet. The Divine Messenger's immediate reaction caught everyone's attention.

""That amulet...It's an amulet the acolytes of the monastery usually wear. It has to belong to one of the captives,"" she exclaimed. ""We're on the right track!""

With this newfound information fueling their determination, the group continued on their path, hoping they were drawing nearer to their targets.",256,"当队伍继续前进时，他们在雪中发现了一样埋藏的东西——一枚精美的护身符。神圣使者的即时反应引起了所有人的注意。  
“那枚护身符……是修道院的侍者们通常佩戴的护身符。它一定属于其中一名被俘者，”她惊呼道。“我们走在正确的道路上！”  
随着这一新发现的信息激励着他们的决心，队伍继续沿着道路前进，希望他们离目标越来越近。"
1834454234337280,WORLDEVENT256_PAGE2,"For hours, the group marched tirelessly, yet still, their targets were nowhere in sight. Though they occasionally discovered traces that assured them they were on the right path, weariness was beginning to take its toll on the adventurers. The Guild Master observed how the divine messenger appeared remarkably resilient, seemingly untouched by fatigue, while her bodyguard already struggled to keep up. They couldn't help but wonder if her endurance was also due to the blessing of the gods.

Recognizing the growing fatigue among the adventurers, the Guild Master suggested taking a brief rest before continuing. The divine messenger, however, was against the suggestion. She argued that stopping might cause them to lose the trails of the jotuns and their captives.",256,"他们不知疲倦地行军了数小时，但目标依然无影无踪。尽管偶尔发现了一些迹象让他们确信自己走在正确的道路上，但疲惫开始在冒险者们身上显现。公会会长观察到，神圣使者似乎异常坚韧，似乎没有受到疲劳的影响，而她的护卫已经显得力不从心。他们不禁想知道，她的耐力是否也得益于神灵的祝福。  
意识到冒险者们日益增长的疲惫，公会会长建议在继续之前稍作休息。然而，神圣使者对此表示反对。她认为停下来可能会导致他们失去巨人和被俘者的踪迹。"

They emphasized that even if they caught up to their targets, they wouldn't be of any help if they were in no condition to save the captives. Reluctantly, the divine messenger finally relented. The group settled down for a much-needed rest and shared a meal to rejuvenate their spirits.

After the short break, the adventurers felt revitalized and ready to resume their pursuit.",256,"尽管神圣使者抗议，公会会长还是成功说服了她，认为休息是必要的。他们强调，即使追上了目标，如果他们的状态无法拯救被俘者，也无济于事。神圣使者不情愿地最终妥协了。队伍安顿下来，进行了一次急需的休息，并分享了一顿饭以恢复精神。

1834454234337285,WORLDEVENT257_PAGE1,"As the march continued, the Guild Master couldn't help but notice a gradual drop in temperature. Before long, their fears were confirmed—a fierce snowstorm began to sweep through the area. The wind howled, biting through their clothes, and the temperature plummeted to bone-chilling levels, causing even those with thick garments to shiver uncontrollably.

Caught in the midst of this storm, the group were faced with an important decision: press on despite the harsh conditions or seek shelter and wait for the tempest to subside.

The Divine Messenger, however, looked like she was determined to continue marching.",257,"随着行军的继续，公会会长不禁注意到气温逐渐下降。不久，他们的担忧得到了证实——一场猛烈的暴风雪开始席卷整个地区。狂风呼啸，刺骨的寒风穿透了他们的衣物，气温骤降至令人发抖的水平，甚至那些穿着厚重衣物的人也不禁颤抖。  
在这场风暴中，队伍面临着一个重要的决定：在恶劣的条件下继续前进，还是寻找避难所等待风暴平息。  
然而，神圣使者看起来决心继续前进。"

""We'll rest, regain our energy, and once the blizzard passes, we'll continue our pursuit.""

For a moment the Divine Messenger looked like she was about to say something but then decided not to and instead just nodded. They sought refuge in a nearby cave, huddling together for warmth as the snowstorm raged outside. The Guild Master noticed how the bodyguard bowed their head, seemingly offering a silent prayer, likely praying for the safety of the captives. In contrast, the Divine Messenger only gazed at the snowstorm in contemplative silence. The Guild Master wondered if someone who had direct connections with the gods has a different view on praying.",257,"“我们会找到最近的避难所，等待风暴过去，”公会会长坚定地宣布，重视冒险者们的生命和力量高于当前的任务。“我们会休息，恢复精力，一旦暴风雪过去，我们就会继续追击。”  
神圣使者一度看起来想说些什么，但最终选择了沉默，点了点头。他们在附近的洞穴中寻求庇护，紧紧挤在一起以抵御外面的寒风暴雪。公会会长注意到护卫低下了头，似乎在默默祈祷，可能是在为被俘者的安全祈祷。相比之下，神圣使者只是静静地凝视着风暴，陷入沉思。公会会长想知道，直接与神灵有联系的人是否对祈祷有不同的看法。"

As the snowstorm raged around them, the Guild Master noticed that even with her blessings, it became evident that the bitter cold was now also taking its toll on the Divine Messenger. And yet, it seemed that the snowstorm could not slow her down.

The cold wind whipped through them like a cruel adversary, affecting them not only physically but also mentally. The biting chill seemed to penetrate their very souls, testing the limits of their endurance. Frostbite threatened some of the adventurers, yet despite the hardships and suffering, they pressed forward.

Then, as if fate were finally smiling upon them, the weather began to relent. The storm clouds parted, revealing the azure sky beyond.",257,"队伍决定继续追击，尽管暴风雪肆虐。随着暴风雪在他们周围肆虐，公会会长注意到，即使在她的祝福下，刺骨的寒冷也开始对神圣使者造成影响。然而，似乎暴风雪并没有减缓她的步伐。  
寒风如同残酷的对手般抽打着他们，不仅在身体上造成影响，也在心理上施加压力。刺骨的寒冷似乎渗透到他们的灵魂深处，考验着他们的耐力极限。冻伤威胁着一些冒险者，但尽管遭受着艰难和痛苦，他们依然向前迈进。
