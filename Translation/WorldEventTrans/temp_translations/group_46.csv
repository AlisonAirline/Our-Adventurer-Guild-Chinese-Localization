1834453940736003,WORLDEVENT144_PAGE1,"As the battle unfolded and the adventurers prepared to strike down the Elder, Emily intervened, stepping in between and vehemently calling for everyone to stop.

""Why are we fighting?"" she yelled. ""Please, just stop this pointless fight!""

Miraculously, it seems that Emily's action actually put a stop to the fighting, as both the adventurers and the Lephoz were stopped in their tracks by the unexpected turn of events. The atmosphere remained tense, however, and both sides still eyed each other nervously. 
Then suddenly, the Elder shouted something, prompting the Lephoz warriors to drop their weapons. The adventurers, under the Guild Master's instruction, followed suit. In a sudden turn of events, the factions, previously locked in combat, agreed to a truce.

Hopi, who had chosen to stay out of the conflict, returned. The Elder shifted his attention to Emily, posing a question in his language.

""What is your name, girl?"" Hopi translated.",144,"随着战斗的展开，冒险者们准备将长老击倒，艾米莉却插手了，站在中间，激烈地呼喊着大家停止。  

“我们为什么要打斗？”她大喊。“请，停止这场无谓的争斗！”  

奇迹般地，艾米莉的举动似乎真的制止了战斗，冒险者和勒福兹都因这一突发事件停下了脚步。然而，气氛依然紧张，双方仍然紧张地互相打量。  
然后，长老突然大喊了一声，促使勒福兹的战士们放下武器。在公会会长的指示下，冒险者们也随之而动。在这一突发事件中，之前交战的双方达成了停战协议。  

选择不参与冲突的霍皮回来了。长老将注意力转向艾米莉，用他的语言提出了一个问题。  

“你叫什么名字，女孩？”霍皮翻译道。"
1834453940736004,WORLDEVENT144_PAGE2,"""Eh, my name? It's Emily Altem, sir!"" she bowed awkwardly, unsure if the gesture carried the same meaning for the Lephoz. ""I'm really sorry if what I said before offended you."" Strangely, Emily's name seemed to hold significance for the Elder. ""You, Altem?"" Hopi relayed the question.

""Y-yes, that's my name,"" Emily answered, puzzled by the Elder's interest. He appeared deep in thought before uttering something. The translation Hopi provided was unexpected.

""I'll guide you to Flower of Eternity.""",144,"“呃，我的名字？是艾米莉·阿尔特姆，先生！”她尴尬地鞠了一躬，不确定这个动作对勒福兹是否有相同的意义。“如果我之前说的话冒犯了您，我真的很抱歉。”奇怪的是，艾米莉的名字似乎对长老有着重要的意义。“你，阿尔特姆？”霍皮转达了这个问题。  

“是的，那是我的名字，”艾米莉回答，困惑于长老的兴趣。他似乎陷入了沉思，然后说出了一些话。霍皮提供的翻译让人意外。  

“我将带你去永恒之花。”"
1834453940736005,WORLDEVENT145_PAGE1,"The group found themselves in what appeared to be a secluded grove, far removed from any discernible path. Beneath a colossal tree sat a creature, a strange mixture of woman and flower. However, it seemed like many parts of her were missing, and yet there was a hint of the beauty it used to be.

""This is Flower of Eternity,"" Hopi translated the Elder's words.

A sudden realization washed over Emily and her face turned pale.

The creature, now identified as the Flower of Eternity, seemed to sense their presence despite her covered eyes. She called out, and the Elder rushed to her side, talking in a gentle tone they didn't know he was capable of.
",145,"这群人发现自己身处一个看似与任何可辨认的小路相隔遥远的隐秘林地。一个巨大的树下坐着一个生物，奇怪地混合了女人和花的特征。然而，她似乎缺失了许多部分，但仍然隐约透出曾经的美丽。  

“这就是永恒之花，”霍皮翻译了长老的话。  

突然，艾米莉意识到什么，脸色变得苍白。  

现在被认定为永恒之花的生物似乎感知到了他们的存在，尽管她的眼睛被遮住了。她呼唤着，长老急忙跑到她身边，用他们不知道他能说出的温柔语气交谈。"
1834453944930304,WORLDEVENT145_PAGE2,"Then, turning towards them, she spoke in a language they could understand, ""I heard there is an Altem amongst you.""

""Y-yes! That would be me, ma'am!"" Emily responded promptly.

""Please, come over so that I can feel you,"" the Flower of Eternity softly requested.

Emily approached, and for a moment,  the Guild Master wondered if they should stop her. However, they could tell from Emily's expression that she wants to do this. As she drew near, the creature extended her remaining arm, touching Emily's face. After tracing her features, the Flower of Eternity then withdrew her hand.

",145,"然后，她转向他们，用他们能理解的语言说道：“我听说你们中有一个阿尔特姆。”  

“是的！那就是我，女士！”艾米莉迅速回应。  

“请过来，让我感受你，”永恒之花轻声请求。  

艾米莉走近，公会会长一瞬间犹豫是否应该阻止她。然而，他们从艾米莉的表情中看出她想要这样做。当她靠近时，生物伸出她剩下的手，轻触艾米莉的脸。在描摹她的轮廓后，永恒之花收回了手。"
1834453944930305,WORLDEVENT145_PAGE3,"""It's similar but not him,"" the creature noted, sounding slightly disappointed.

""Are you talking about my ancestor? Kayle Altem?"" Emily inquired.

A sad smile appeared on the creature's face. ""Ancestor, huh? Has it been so long already?"" she lamented. ""Then that means he's already gone,"" she added, falling silent.

""Are you the Flower of Eternity?"" Emily eventually asked, breaking the silence. Her face had a sorrowful look that accompanied her ever since they learned of the Flower of Eternity's form.

",145,"“这很相似，但不是他，”生物注意到，语气中带着一丝失望。  

“你是在说我的祖先吗？凯尔·阿尔特姆？”艾米莉询问。  

生物的脸上浮现出一抹悲伤的微笑。“祖先吗？已经过了这么久了吗？”她感叹道。“那么这意味着他已经离开了，”她补充道，随即沉默。  

“你是永恒之花吗？”艾米莉最终打破了沉默。自从他们得知永恒之花的形态后，她的脸上一直挂着悲伤的神情。"
1834453944930306,WORLDEVENT145_PAGE4,"""That's what humans used to call me, I think,"" the creature replied. ""It was such a long time ago. I don't remember much, but I remember the fear I felt towards them."" It was easy for the Guild Master to imagine what the creature might have endured, if even only a fraction of the legendary properties associated with the Flower of Eternity were true. It couldn't have been an easy life.

Tears suddenly started to fall from Emily's eyes.

""Why are you sad, child?"" the creature asked, somehow sensing Emily's sorrow.

""B-because *sob* it must have been so hard for you! I can't even imagine what you had to go through in your life!"" Emily responded through tears. The creature embraced Emily and smiled. ""You're just as kind as he was,"" she said and with this Emily's search for the Flower Of Eternity came to an unexpected end.",145,"“那是人类曾经称呼我的名字，我想，”生物回答。“那是很久以前的事了。我记得不多，但我记得我对他们的恐惧。”公会会长很容易想象出生物可能经历了什么，如果与永恒之花相关的传奇特性即使只有一小部分是真的，那生活一定不容易。  

艾米莉的眼泪突然流下。  

“孩子，你为什么悲伤？”生物问道，似乎感知到了艾米莉的悲伤。  

“因为 *呜咽* 这对你来说一定是如此艰难！我无法想象你在生活中经历了什么！”艾米莉泪流满面地回应。生物拥抱了艾米莉，微笑着说：“你和他一样善良。”就这样，艾米莉寻找永恒之花的旅程意外地画上了句号。"
1834453944930307,WORLDEVENT145RESULT0_PAGE1,"After a while, the group decided it was time to return to the Guild. They now knew the form of the Flower of Eternity, and Emily decided to keep its existence a secret. As they prepared to leave, the Flower of Eternity wanted to give something to Emily. Breaking a part of her wooden horn, she offered it to Emily. Emily wanted to decline but the Flower of Eternity insisted.

""This is only a small part of me and will eventually grow back. Even then, I know there is great potency in it,"" the creature explained. ""Please take this gift in place of your ancestor, who has done so much for me."" In the end she accepted the gift.

 Emily promised to treat it with the utmost respect and create something amazing with it. 

And so, their journey back began.",145,"过了一会儿，团队决定是时候回到公会了。他们现在知道了永恒之花的形态，而艾米莉决定将其存在保密。当他们准备离开时，永恒之花想要给艾米莉一些东西。她折断了自己的一部分木角，递给艾米莉。艾米莉想要拒绝，但永恒之花坚持道。  

“这只是我一小部分，最终会再生。即便如此，我知道其中蕴含着巨大的力量，”生物解释道。“请把这个礼物带走，代替你的祖先，他为我做了这么多。”最后，她接受了这个礼物。  

艾米莉承诺会以最崇高的敬意对待它，并用它创造出一些惊人的东西。  

于是，他们的归途开始了。"
1834453944930308,WORLDEVENT146_PAGE1,"The party found a pot with food being boiled over a fire. It seems like the goblins were cooking the troll's next meal. The adventurers didn't even want to think about, what the ingredients of the meal might be. 

The surrounding bones in human shape were already clue enough.",146,"队伍发现一个锅，锅里正在火上煮着食物。看起来是哥布林在为巨魔准备下一顿饭。冒险者们甚至不想去想，这顿饭的材料可能是什么。  

周围的人形骨骼已经足够说明一切。"

Unfortunately the content of the pot were now in full view for the adventurers and some of them had to vomit at the sight of it.",146,"队伍推翻了锅，锅里的内容物洒了一地。  
巨魔现在得饿着肚子了。  

不幸的是，锅里的内容物现在完全暴露在冒险者面前，他们中的一些人看到这一幕不得不呕吐。"
