As adventurers they've heard of places like these. They were said to be one of the few remaining places where the god Ghanenta had shed tears for humanity. The place was believed to be imbued with great power, but only one person could take that power before it would disappear. 

There was great value in taking that power but some of them also wondered if they should just leave it be. They noticed the lush forest around them and speculated that it was most likely thanks to the blessed pond.",170,"当冒险者们在茂密的森林中游荡时，他们偶然发现了一个小空地，那里有一个池塘散发着柔和的绿色光芒。出于好奇，他们走近池塘，注意到那闪烁的水面似乎显得有些超凡脱俗。  

作为冒险者，他们听说过这样的地方。传说这是神灵 Ghanenta 为人类流下眼泪的少数几个地方之一。这个地方被认为蕴藏着巨大的力量，但只有一个人可以在力量消失之前获取它。  

获取这股力量的价值巨大，但他们中的一些人也在想是否应该就这样离开。他们注意到周围郁郁葱葱的森林，推测这很可能是由于这个神圣的池塘所带来的。"

As {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} emerged from the pond, the glow faded, and the water returned to its ordinary state. {CHARACTER1} could feel that {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} has become stronger now.
