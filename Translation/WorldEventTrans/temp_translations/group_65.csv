A small flame flickered in its center, and as they approached, the fire unexpectedly intensified, taking on a humanoid form. Though the adventurers were cautious, the entity showed no immediate hostility.

""Have you come to pay respect to my shrine, humans?"" inquired the being. The adventurers denied any such intention.

The being became agitated and began to express its frustration. ""This is unbelievable! You humans seem to have forgotten who I am! I am Ifrit! Once, I had countless followers! Yet, not a single one of you has paid me any respect in centuries!""
",201,"冒险者们偶然发现了一个古老的神殿，似乎被遗弃了无尽的岁月。中央有一小团火焰在闪烁，当他们靠近时，火焰意外地变得更加旺盛，呈现出人形。尽管冒险者们十分谨慎，但这个存在并没有表现出立即的敌意。  

“你们是来向我的神殿致敬的，凡人吗？”那存在询问道。冒险者们否认了这样的意图。

""I may also need a human to be my herald. Is there anyone among you worthy to spread my faith?""",201,"冒险者们怀疑这个火焰实体可能是某个曾经被崇敬为神明的强大火元素。看来它在岁月中失去了追随者。难怪，考虑到教会通常压制崇拜虚假神明的信仰。
