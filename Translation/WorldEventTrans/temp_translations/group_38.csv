The rest of the party could only watch in horror as lightning crackled around {CHARACTER1}, preventing anyone from getting close.

Finally, the crystal began to dissolve in {CHARACTER1}'s hand, melting into {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} body. A last burst of lightning sent {CHARACTER1} flying into the wall, and then everything was quiet.

As the party rushed over to check on {CHARACTER1}, they found that {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} was bruised but otherwise unharmed. But as they looked closer, they saw that the crystal had fused with {CHARACTER1}'s forehead, forming a third eye that glowed with an eerie light.

Despite the party's concern, {CHARACTER1} seemed unfazed by the strange new appendage. In fact, {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} claimed that {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} could see things more clearly than ever before. With no other choice, the party decided to continue on with their quest, hoping that the crystal will not cause any harm to {CHARACTER1} in the future.",118,"{CHARACTER1} 决定听从那个声音，尽管感到剧痛，仍然紧握着水晶。其余的队伍只能惊恐地看着，闪电在 {CHARACTER1} 周围闪烁，阻止任何人靠近。

最终，水晶开始在 {CHARACTER1} 的手中溶解，融入了 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他的|=0?她的} 身体。一道最后的闪电将 {CHARACTER1} 撞向墙壁，然后一切都安静下来。

当队伍急忙赶来查看 {CHARACTER1} 的情况时，他们发现 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 受了伤，但其他方面并无大碍。然而，当他们仔细观察时，发现水晶已经与 {CHARACTER1} 的额头融合，形成了一个发出诡异光芒的第三只眼。

尽管队伍感到担忧，{CHARACTER1} 对这个奇怪的新附属物似乎毫不在意。事实上，{GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 声称 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 能比以往更清楚地看到事物。无奈之下，队伍决定继续他们的任务，希望水晶将来不会对 {CHARACTER1} 造成伤害。"

The rest of the party could only watch in horror as the lightning surrounding the crystal intensified, crackling with a blinding brightness that made it impossible to approach {CHARACTER1}.


But {CHARACTER1}'s endurance had a limit, and it seemed that the crystal knew it. The lightning slowly began to fade, and {CHARACTER1} collapsed to the ground, unmoving.


The rest of the party rushed over to {CHARACTER1}'s side, fearing the worst. But to their relief, {CHARACTER1} was still breathing, though barely conscious and gravely injured. The crystal that had caused all this havoc had disappeared without a trace, leaving the party to wonder what had just occured.",118,"{CHARACTER1} 咬紧牙关，尽管剧烈的疼痛在 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 的身体中蔓延，仍然紧握着水晶。其余的队伍只能惊恐地看着，围绕水晶的闪电愈发强烈，闪烁着刺眼的光芒，让人无法靠近 {CHARACTER1}。

但 {CHARACTER1} 的耐力有其极限，似乎水晶也知道这一点。闪电慢慢开始减弱，{CHARACTER1} 倒在地上，动不了。

队伍的其他成员急忙赶到 {CHARACTER1} 的身边，担心最坏的情况。但让他们松了一口气的是，{CHARACTER1} 仍在呼吸，虽然意识模糊且重伤。引发这一切混乱的水晶已经无影无踪，留下队伍在思考刚刚发生了什么。"

In a blinding flash, the crystal exploded into countless shards of shimmering light, leaving the party stunned and disoriented. When they recovered their senses, the crystal was gone. As the party tended to the burn marks on {CHARACTER1}'s hand, they wondered what just happened.",118,"{CHARACTER1} 忽视了 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 头中的声音，立刻放开了水晶。水晶周围的空气因强烈的能量而闪烁，导致 {CHARACTER1} 和其余的队伍四处寻找掩护。

在一阵刺眼的闪光中，水晶爆炸成无数闪烁的光芒碎片，令队伍目瞪口呆。当他们恢复意识时，水晶已经消失。队伍在为 {CHARACTER1} 手上的烧伤处理时，纷纷猜测刚刚发生了什么。"

Upon closer inspection, the adventurers noticed that there was a message attached to the arrow. They retrieved it and read:

这时，他们还注意到箭嵌入的地方靠近似乎是蜘蛛的足迹。可以合理推测，这些足迹属于信息中提到的那群野兽。"
