However, the battle for Nora's life was still ongoing. Eden maintained his focus, his hands still on her, tirelessly chanting his healing spell. His face had paled from exhaustion, but he did not stop. Beside Nora, the Guild Master sat, holding her hand and talking to her to keep her conscious.

Then finally, it was over. Eden collapsed backward, and it became apparent that Nora was out of danger. Her face softened, and color returned to her once-pale cheeks. The wound had vanished, and the only reminder of it was a small hole in Nora's robe. She pushed herself up. She was still weak, but her condition was stable now. ""Mr. Eden..."" she began...

""YOU STUPID GIRL!"" Eden screamed with such intensity that even the Guild Master felt slightly terrified. Like a kid hearing the outburst of a parent.
""What were you thinking doing something that dangerous!"" he continued to yell. 

""Did you even think what could have happened there?!

You could have died!

You..."" his voice started to falter.",131,"与强盗的战斗结束了。  

然而，诺拉的生命之战仍在继续。伊登保持着专注，双手依然放在她身上，不知疲倦地吟唱着治疗咒语。他的脸因疲惫而变得苍白，但他没有停下。诺拉身边，公会会长坐着，握着她的手，和她说话以保持她的意识。  

最后，终于结束了。伊登向后倒下，显然诺拉已经脱离了危险。她的脸色变得柔和，曾经苍白的脸颊恢复了颜色。伤口消失了，唯一的提醒是诺拉袍子上的一个小洞。她撑起身体。她仍然虚弱，但现在情况稳定了。“伊登先生……”她开始说……  

“你这个愚蠢的女孩！”伊登大声吼道，声音之大甚至让公会会长感到略微恐惧。就像孩子听到父母的怒吼。  
“你在想什么，竟然做出如此危险的事！”他继续大喊。  

“你有没有想过那可能会发生什么？！  

你可能会死的！  

你……”他的声音开始颤抖。"
1834453911375874,WORLDEVENT131_PAGE2,"""You... could have died... Because of me."" Eden covered his face, and tears began to fall. ""H-Have I really pushed you so far? That you'd think to just throw your life away like that?"" His voice trembled, ""I-I'm a monster!""

""N-no! You aren't!"" Nora protested, crawling towards Eden. ""You're the kindest man I know. It's my fault that...""
""IT'S NOT!"" Eden yelled, still covering his face in shame. ""It never was! And I should never have let you believe that!""

He began to sob uncontrollably, as if all the guilt he had felt over the years was finally crashing down on him at once.

""P-Please! Stop!"" Nora begged Eden, her eyes filled with tears.
""You should hate me!"" he cried out.
""I love you like a father!"" Nora cried back. She embraced him, crying as hard as Eden did.
",131,"“你……可能会死……都是因为我。”伊登捂住脸，泪水开始流下。“我……真的把你推得这么远吗？让你觉得可以轻易放弃自己的生命？”他的声音颤抖着，“我……是个怪物！”  

“不是的！你不是！”诺拉抗议着，向伊登爬去。“你是我认识的最善良的人。是我的错……”  
“不是！”伊登大喊，仍然羞愧地捂着脸。“从来都不是！我不该让你相信这一点！”  

他开始失控地哭泣，仿佛多年来的所有愧疚终于在这一刻倾泻而下。  

“请！停下！”诺拉恳求伊登，眼中满是泪水。  
“你应该恨我！”他大声喊道。  
“我像爱父亲一样爱你！”诺拉回应道。她紧紧拥抱着他，和伊登一样痛哭。"
1834453911375875,WORLDEVENT131RESULT0_PAGE1,"It took a while before Nora and Eden finally calmed down. The Guild Master and the adventurers were considerate enough to give them the time they needed to sort out their feelings.

When they were finally able to resume their journey, there was still an awkwardness between Nora and Eden. However, it was different this time. It felt like, after so long, they just weren't sure how to interact with each other anymore. Sensing their predicament, the Guild Master started to bring up topics that both of them could join in, and the whole trip became a lot livelier than it started.",131,"诺拉和伊登终于平静下来花了一些时间。公会会长和冒险者们体贴地给了他们所需的时间来整理情感。  

当他们终于能够继续旅程时，诺拉和伊登之间仍然有些尴尬。然而，这次的感觉不同。似乎在经历了这么久之后，他们不再确定如何相处。感受到他们的困境，公会会长开始提起双方都能参与的话题，整个旅程变得比开始时活跃得多。"
1834453915570176,WORLDEVENT132_PAGE1,"As the group continued to travel towards their destination, an awkward silence lingered in their midst.

Ever since they left the Guild, neither Nora nor Eden have exchanged any words with each other. The few attempts of the Guild Master trying to strike a conversation failed, as both Nora and Eden only replied with short answers, leaving the conversation to die out quickly. At some point the Guild Master stopped trying, and the journey became depressingly silent. The adventurers, caught in the middle, silently hoped for an event to break the awkward atmosphere.

As if in response to their unspoken pleas, the group suddenly detected subtle movements around them.",132,"当队伍继续朝着目的地前进时，尴尬的沉默在他们之间弥漫。  

自从离开公会以来，诺拉和伊登之间没有交换过任何话语。公会会长几次试图开启对话，但诺拉和伊登只用简短的回答回应，导致对话很快就消亡。在某个时刻，公会会长停止了尝试，旅程变得令人沮丧的沉默。冒险者们夹在中间，默默希望能发生一些事情来打破这种尴尬的气氛。  

仿佛回应他们无声的请求，队伍突然察觉到周围有微妙的动静。"
1834453915570177,WORLDEVENT132RESULT0_PAGE1,"Suddenly, a large group of armed men encircled the group. Alarmingly, the Guild Master noticed that many of them bore the same distinctive marks on their faces that were once associated with the Bandit King's notorious gang. It was undeniable; these were the remnants of the Bandit King's army.

""Well, well, well. Look at what we found here. I was hoping to stumble upon some rich travelers to relieve them of their belongings, but to encounter the esteemed Guild Master of the Adventurer Guild themself! What an unexpected honor!"" the apparent leader declared, bowing mockingly. Suddenly, his tone shifted. ""I always dreamed of sinking a dagger between your ribs, after what happened. It seems the demon lords are finally smiling upon us.""

""You wretched fools,"" Eden said. His face, showing the first instance of anger, the Guild Master has ever seen on him. ""You have no idea of the darkness you've invited upon yourselves and others by aligning yourselves with the forces of evil.""

""A priest, huh?"" The Bandit leader regarded Eden with disdain. ""Always the preaching kind. But your sermons won't be lasting much longer.""

A sudden gesture of his hand caught everyone off-guard, and a sudden bolt suddenly flew from the crowd of bandits directly at Eden.",132,"突然，一大群武装男子将队伍包围。公会会长惊恐地注意到，他们中许多人脸上都带有与强盗王臭名昭著的帮派相关的相同标志。毫无疑问；这些是强盗王军队的残余。  

“哦，哦，哦。看看我们在这里发现了什么。我本希望能偶然遇到一些富有的旅行者，来掠夺他们的财物，但没想到竟然遇到了冒险者公会的尊贵会长！真是意外的荣幸！”显然的首领嘲讽地宣称，做了个夸张的鞠躬。然后，他的语气突然转变。“在发生那件事后，我一直梦想着在你肋骨间插入一把匕首。看来恶魔领主终于在我们身上微笑了。”  

“你们这些可恶的愚蠢之徒，”伊登说道。他的脸上露出了公会会长从未见过的愤怒。“你们根本不知道与邪恶势力结盟所带来的黑暗。”  

“一个牧师，是吗？”强盗首领不屑地看着伊登。“总是喜欢说教。但你的讲道不会再持续多久。”  

他突然挥手的动作让所有人都感到意外，突然一支箭矢从强盗人群中飞向伊登。"
1834453915570178,WORLDEVENT133_PAGE1,"In front of the group stood a small gravestone, marking the final resting place of Eden's daughter, Mily. Eden gently touched the gravestone and whispered, ""I'm back,"" a sad smile appearing on his face. He carefully placed some flowers they had collected on their journey beside the gravestone.

Together, the group began to pray in front of the grave.

""I'm sorry, Mily,"" Eden suddenly spoke. ""I'm sure you were worried about me and Nora, and I should have known better. However, I promise you that I will do better. So please be at ease."" A sudden gust swept over them, as if in response, and a warm feeling overcame the group.",133,"在队伍面前矗立着一块小墓碑，标志着伊登女儿米莉的安息之地。伊登轻轻触摸着墓碑，低声说道：“我回来了，”脸上露出一丝悲伤的微笑。他小心翼翼地将他们在旅途中收集的花放在墓碑旁。  

队伍一起开始在墓前祈祷。  

“对不起，米莉，”伊登突然说道。“我知道你一定很担心我和诺拉，我本该更明智。然而，我向你保证我会做得更好。所以请你安心。”一阵突如其来的微风拂过他们，仿佛在回应，温暖的感觉笼罩着整个队伍。"
