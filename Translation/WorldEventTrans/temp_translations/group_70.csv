""T-this is my problem to deal with,"" she stammered, her voice quivering with determination. Though fear still gripped her, Misasa refused to let her friends bear the burden of her mistakes.

Her friends surrounded her, their faces filled with both joy and disbelief. They had not only helped Misasa regain control of her soul, but they had all survived the harrowing ordeal together. It was a moment of overwhelming gratitude and relief. Tackling her with hugs, they embraced Misasa tightly, their tears mingling as they rejoiced in their shared triumph.

Happy sobs echoed through the air as they held each other close, their hearts overflowing with gratitude for the happy ending they had achieved together.

The adventurers gathered around her, their hearts heavy with grief as they mourned the loss of their friend. In the end despite knowing the risk she did not run and abandon her friends.

The ghastly visage of Belephegor frowned at the unexpected turn of events. This was not the outcome he had envisioned, but the terms of their agreement had been met. Misasa's soul would no longer belong to him, a small consolation in the face of their loss.

As Belephegor's presence slowly faded away, the adventurers carried Misasa's body with them. They would hold a funeral that would show how beloved she truly was.",219,"尽管他们英勇的努力，美莎莎在混乱中倒下，身体静静地躺在屠杀的场景中。冒险者们围绕着她，心中沉重，哀悼着失去的朋友。最终，尽管知道风险，她并没有逃跑，放弃她的朋友们。

Her soul had been saved, but it had come at a cost. The sacrifices made by those closest to her weighed heavily on her heart, a burden too heavy to bear alone. She cursed herself for every mistake, every misstep that had led them to this moment. She felt the weight of their loss like a dagger to her soul

They scanned the area, searching for any sign of life, but there was nothing except for an ominous-looking shrine standing silently between two old statues.
