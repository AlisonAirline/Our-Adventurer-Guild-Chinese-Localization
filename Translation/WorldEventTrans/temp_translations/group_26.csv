1834453777158148,WORLDEVENT80_PAGE1,"The adventurers have done the seemingly impossible. They killed a dragon.

Vincent, who had been observing the battle from a hidden vantage point, rushed toward the victorious party, singing their praises.
""I am truly blessed to have witnessed such a magnificent battle,"" Vincent exclaimed. ""My bardic senses are overwhelmed with creativity in this moment. Mighty Dragon Slayers! Your heroic deed will be etched into the annals of history through songs, epics, and all forms of storytelling by yours truly.""

Vincent would have continued showering them with praise if not for the sudden reappearance of the voice from earlier.

""Well done, humans."" The adventurers finally realized that it was the dragon speaking. It wasn't dead yet!

Vincent jumped back in surprise, while the adventurers readied their weapons in fear of retalation.

""Be at ease, humans."" the dragon continued, the voice growing weaker and weaker as it spoke .  ""You have bested me. Death awaits, and soon the shroud of darkness will envelop me.""
",80,"冒险者们完成了看似不可能的任务。他们杀死了一条龙。

在隐秘的观察点上观察战斗的文森特，急匆匆地跑向胜利的队伍，赞美之词不绝于口。  
“我真是太幸运了，能够目睹如此壮丽的战斗，”文森特兴奋地说道。“在这一刻，我的吟游诗人感官被创造力淹没。强大的屠龙者们！你们的英雄事迹将通过我的歌曲、史诗和各种叙述形式铭刻在历史的篇章中。”

如果不是之前那个声音的突然重现，文森特本会继续赞美他们。

“干得不错，人类。”冒险者们终于意识到是那条龙在说话。它还没有死去！

文森特惊讶地跳了回去，而冒险者们则因恐惧报复而准备好武器。

“放轻松，人类。”龙继续说道，声音越来越弱。“你们战胜了我。死亡在等待着我，黑暗的斗篷即将笼罩我。”"
1834453781352448,WORLDEVENT80_PAGE2,"""A talking dragon?"" Vincent's initial fear gave way to an overwhelming sense of excitement for the extraordinary situation.  ""This is unprecedented! How? Why? I have so many questions!""

The dragon let out a weak laugh. ""How unfortunate for you, bard, that my time is coming to an end. For me, however, I welcome it. I have lived for far too long, and it's a blessing to meet my demise in battle before age has claimed me.""

The dragon's gaze settled upon the adventurers. ""Oh, mighty warriors. Inside my body, you will find an orb that can bestow upon you a portion of a dragon's power. Accept this gift, and may your foes quiver in terror."" With those words, the dragon's voice faded into silence, marking its final moments.

As the dragon had requested, the adventurers started the task of dismantling the mighty creature.",80,"“一条会说话的龙？”文森特最初的恐惧转变为对这一非凡情况的强烈兴奋。“这前所未有！怎么会？为什么？我有太多问题！”

龙发出微弱的笑声。“可怜的吟游诗人，你的时间即将结束。对我来说，我欢迎这一切。我活得太久了，能够在战斗中迎接我的死亡是一种祝福，而不是等到衰老夺走我。”

龙的目光落在冒险者们身上。“哦，强大的战士们。在我的身体里，你们会发现一个可以赋予你们部分龙之力量的宝珠。接受这个礼物，让你们的敌人颤抖不已。”随着这些话，龙的声音渐渐消失，标志着它的最后时刻。

按照龙的要求，冒险者们开始了拆解这只强大生物的任务。"
1834453781352449,WORLDEVENT81_PAGE1,"The adventurers and Bai finally found the swordsman they were looking for. Upon spotting the man, Bai displayed an unusual expression—a troubled one.

The swordsman was a man with long black hair, wearing a simple white mask covering part of his face. His appearance and attire bore a resemblance to Bai and the adventurers wondered if there was any connection between the two.

""Ugh... It's you,"" Bai said, her tone tinged with annoyance. ""I got excited for nothing.""

""Bai, Bai, Bai..."" the man began, adopting a theatrical demeanor. ""How could you just leave the village without telling me? You're breaking my heart,"" he quipped while dramatically clutching his chest. ""I was afraid I would never see you again, but luckily for me, I knew exactly how to catch your attention.""

",81,"冒险者们和白终于找到了他们寻找的剑士。看到那个人，白露出了不同寻常的表情——困扰的神情。

剑士是一个长发黑发的男人，戴着一只简单的白色面具，遮住了他部分的脸。他的外貌和服装与白相似，冒险者们不禁想知道两者之间是否有联系。

“呃……是你，”白说道，语气中带着恼怒。“我白兴奋一场。”

“白，白，白……”那人开始以戏剧化的姿态说道。“你怎么能不告诉我就离开村子呢？你让我心碎，”他一边说着，一边戏剧性地捂住胸口。“我担心再也见不到你，但幸运的是，我知道如何引起你的注意。”"
1834453781352450,WORLDEVENT81_PAGE2,"It became evident to the adventurers that the swordsman had been challenging swordmasters across the country, all in a bid to draw out Bai. But the question remained: for what purpose?

""What do you want, Shen?"" Bai inquired, losing interest by the minute.

""You know what I want, Bai!"" Shen responded, drawing his sword gracefully from its sheath and adopting a poised fighting stance. ""I want to settle the matter between us! Fight me!""

However, in stark contrast to Shen, who had readied himself for a fight, Bai simply stood there apathetically. Then, to the surprise of the adventurers, she gave an unexpected answer:

""No!""",81,"冒险者们很快意识到，这位剑士一直在全国挑战剑术大师，都是为了引出白。但问题是：他的目的是什么？

“你想要什么，沈？”白询问，兴趣逐渐减退。

“你知道我想要什么，白！”沈回应，优雅地从鞘中抽出剑，摆出一个优雅的战斗姿势。“我想解决我们之间的问题！来战斗吧！”

然而，与已经准备好战斗的沈形成鲜明对比的是，白只是无动于衷地站在那里。然后，令冒险者们惊讶的是，她给出了一个意想不到的回答：

“不要！”"
1834453781352451,WORLDEVENT81_PAGE3,"""You can't run from me forever, Bai!"" Shen exclaimed. ""You will have to fight me!""

""I've told you already."" Bai responded, "" If Yu wants me defeated, he should do it himself."" For a moment, the swordsman seemed troubled by Bai's words.

""It doesn't matter whether Yu or I defeat you. It's the same thing.""

""It's not,"" Bai retorted, growing increasingly irritated. ""Just take off the damn mask!""

The adventurers couldn't quite follow the conversation anymore. Who was this Yu, and why did he want to see Bai defeated?
",81,"“你不能永远逃避我，白！”沈喊道。“你必须和我战斗！”

“我已经告诉过你了。”白回应道，“如果宇想让我被打败，他应该自己来。”片刻间，剑士似乎被白的话困扰。

“无论是宇还是我打败你，结果都是一样的。”

“不是的，”白反驳，愈发恼怒。“把该死的面具摘掉！”

冒险者们已经无法跟上这段对话了。这个宇是谁，他为什么想要看到白被打败？"
1834453781352452,WORLDEVENT81RESULT0_PAGE1,"""Enough! I went to great lengths to find you! I will not let you leave until I've had my fight!"" Shen declared, his tone leaving no room for further arguments. Bai appeared troubled, an uncharacteristic look on her face, and her hesitation added to the oddity of the situation – for some reason she didn't seem to want to engage in a battle with the swordsman.

Then, a sudden smile broke across Bai's face, her expression shifting in a way that sent an uneasy feeling rippling through the adventurers.

""Fine, you can have your fight. Against them!"" She pointed directly at the adventurers, who couldn't help but groan in response.

""If you can defeat them, then I'll consider fighting you,"" Bai continued.

Shen, the swordsman, responded with an arrogant smile. ""Fine. A little warm-up will do me good before the real fight."" With that, he launched his attack without giving the party any chance to protest.",81,"“够了！我费尽心思找到你！在我打完之前你不能离开！”沈宣称，语气中没有进一步争论的余地。白显得困扰，脸上露出不寻常的神情，而她的犹豫更增添了这一情况的奇怪——出于某种原因，她似乎并不想与剑士交战。

然后，白的脸上突然露出了微笑，她的表情转变让冒险者们感到一阵不安。

“好吧，你可以和我战斗。对他们！”她直接指向冒险者们，冒险者们不禁发出呻吟声。

“如果你能打败他们，我就考虑和你战斗，”白继续说道。

剑士沈露出傲慢的微笑。“好吧。在真正的战斗之前，热身一下对我有好处。”说完，他便发起了攻击，根本不给队伍抗议的机会。"
1834453785546752,WORLDEVENT82_PAGE1,"The adventurers had managed to defeat the swordsman, leaving him on his knees, shocked and defeated.

""Impossible... How could I lose?"" Shen muttered in disbelief.

Bai, meanwhile, appeared proud of the adventurers' victory. ""Of course, you'd lose. I'm one of their trainers, after all."" She started laughing, clearly amused by the turn of events. ""Now, you better let us go, or I'll have them beat you up some more.""",82,"冒险者们成功击败了剑士，让他跪在地上，震惊而失败。

“这不可能……我怎么会输？”沈难以置信地喃喃自语。

与此同时，白对冒险者们的胜利感到骄傲。“当然，你会输。我毕竟是他们的教练。”她开始大笑，显然对这一转折感到 amused。“现在，你最好让我们离开，否则我就让他们再揍你一顿。”"
1834453785546753,WORLDEVENT82RESULT0_PAGE1,"""Fine... I'll let you go,"" Shen conceded.

""However, I will come with you!"" He said enthusiastically, bouncing back on his feet as if the recent fight had never happened.

""What?!"" Bai exclaimed, clearly caught off guard by this turn of events.

""Did you really think I'd give up so easily, my dear?"" Shen asked theatrically. ""I may have lost the battle, but not the war.""
""Ughh..."" Bai seemed less than thrilled about Shen wanting to tag along. Sensing her dissatisfaction, Shen added a final offer, ""If you let me come, I'll let you see Yu."" Hearing this, Bai's expression changed visibly.

""You're not messing with me, are you?"" She asked skeptically.

""You have my word,"" Shen replied. Despite her annoyance, Bai reluctantly agreed, saying, ""Fine. You can tag along, but keep your distance as long as you wear that ugly mask.""

The adventurers weren't entirely sure what had just happened, but it appeared that everything has been...resolved?",82,"“好吧……我会让你们离开，”沈妥协道。

“不过，我要和你们一起去！”他兴奋地说道，像是最近的战斗从未发生过一样，重新站了起来。

“什么？！”白惊叫，显然对这一转折感到意外。

“你真的以为我会这么轻易放弃吗，我亲爱的？”沈戏剧性地问。“我可能输了战斗，但并没有输掉战争。”  
“呃……”白似乎对沈想要跟着感到不太高兴。察觉到她的不满，沈补充了最后的提议，“如果你让我来，我就让你见宇。”听到这话，白的表情明显变化。

“你不是在跟我开玩笑吧？”她怀疑地问。

“我向你保证，”沈回答。尽管她感到恼火，白还是勉强同意，说：“好吧。你可以跟着，但只要你戴着那副丑陋的面具，就保持距离。”

冒险者们对刚刚发生的事情并不完全确定，但看起来一切都……解决了？"
