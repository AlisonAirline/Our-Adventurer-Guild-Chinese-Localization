1834454276280320,WORLDEVENT280_PAGE1,"As the adventurers stepped into the concealed fortress, a gruesome scene unfolded before them. Blood adorned the hall, mingling with the remains of cultists strewn about. At the heart of the chamber stood a figure the Guild Master immediately recognized: The Emperor.

Before the Emperor loomed a massive, magical orb containing what seems to be a towering woman—the sealed goddess they sought to free.

""It appears you've managed to find my resting place,"" the Emperor remarked, his voice tinged with malice. ""But alas, you're too late. I have returned to this world as you can see.""
",280,"当冒险者们踏入隐秘的堡垒时，一幅惨烈的场景展现在他们面前。大厅里满是鲜血，和四散的邪教徒遗骸交织在一起。在大厅的中央，伫立着一个身影，行会会长立刻认出了他：皇帝。

在皇帝面前，悬浮着一个巨大的魔法球，里面似乎封印着一位高大的女性——他们试图解放的女神。

“看来你们找到了我的安息之地，”皇帝冷冷地说道，声音中透着恶意。“可惜，你们来得太晚了。正如你们所见，我已经回到这个世界。”"
1834454276280321,WORLDEVENT280_PAGE2,"""How?!"" cried the Divine Messenger in confusion. ""The gods were certain you had not yet amassed enough souls. How, then..."" Her gaze swept over the lifeless forms of the cultists.

""It's precisely as you think, child,"" the Emperor retorted coldly. ""My followers sacrificed themselves for my sake. So that I could return and lead the world."" The Guild Master observed the corpses, noting signs of resistance among some. It was clear that some were clearly not as willing as he claimed.

""It doesn't matter,"" the Guild Master declared. ""You are just one man. We will just put you back in your coffin and free the goddess.""
",280,"“怎么可能？！”神圣使者困惑地喊道。“众神确信你还没有积攒足够的灵魂。那么，怎么会……”她的目光扫过那些无生命的邪教徒尸体。

“正如你所想，孩子，”皇帝冷冷地反驳道。“我的追随者为了我而自我牺牲。为了让我能够归来并统治这个世界。”行会会长观察着尸体，注意到一些人身上有抵抗的迹象。显然，有些人并没有他所声称的那么愿意。

“这无所谓，”行会会长宣告道。“你不过是一个人。我们只需把你放回棺材里，解放女神。”"
1834454276280322,WORLDEVENT280RESULT0_PAGE1,"""Just one man?"" the Emperor scoffed. ""I AM THE EMPEROR!""

A gust of wind heralded his proclamation. ""I AM THE SOVEREIGN RULER OF THESE REALMS, AND EVEN THE BEASTS BOW BEFORE ME!"" From the shadows, a horde of monsters materialized, positioning themselves between the adventurers and the Emperor.

""MY LEGIONS HAVE CONQUERED NATIONS AND REMAIN BOUND TO MY WILL, EVEN IN DEATH!"" Ancient corpses stirred, raising their arms in allegiance once more.
",280,"“不过是一个人？”皇帝嗤之以鼻。“我就是皇帝！”

一阵狂风宣告着他的宣言。“我就是这些领域的至高统治者，甚至连野兽也在我面前俯首称臣！”从阴影中，成群的怪物显现出来，挡在冒险者和皇帝之间。

“我的军团征服了国家，即使在死亡中也依然受我支配！”古老的尸体再次动了起来，举起手臂表示效忠。"
1834454276280323,WORLDEVENT280RESULT0_PAGE2,"The Emperor pointed at the adventurers. ""You have but two options: kneel or perish!""

The Guild Master looked at the adventurers and without exchanging a single word each of them simply gave the Guild Master a determined smile. 

""You have chosen poorly, adventurers,"" the Emperor declared coldly.

The Guild Master led the Divine Messenger and her Guard to a safe distance. In this fight they would be nothing more than a burden.
And so, the final confrontation against the Emperor was about to start.",280,"皇帝指着冒险者们。“你们只有两个选择：跪下或死去！”

行会会长看着冒险者们，彼此之间没有交换一个字，他们只是给了行会会长一个坚定的微笑。

“你们选择得真糟糕，冒险者们，”皇帝冷冷地宣告。

行会会长带着神圣使者和她的护卫退到安全的距离。在这场战斗中，他们不过是一个负担。
于是，最终与皇帝的对抗即将开始。"
1834454276280324,WORLDEVENT281_PAGE1,"The Battle has become a foregone conclusion and yet the Emperor refused to yield. Covered in wounds, he still kept swinging his sword, fighting alone with every ally already dead.

However, in the end, the Emperor's shattered body betrayed him, and he collapsed, his sword slipping from his grasp. Desperately, he reached for his weapon, crying out,

""THIS CANNOT BE THE END! 
WHAT WAS IT ALL FOR? 
EVERY SACRIFICE I MADE! EVERY LIFE I TOOK! 

IT CANNOT BE ALL FOR NAUGHT!""""

His shouts echoed the hall, as he continued his futile attempts to reclaim his sword...until, at last, he fell silent.

The Guild Master could see that the Emperor was still alive and approached him with a drawn dagger. When the Guild Master stood above the Emperor, the Emperor didn't seem to even notice. The Guild Master noticed a vacant expression in his eyes and recognized the look of a man who has abandoned all hope. A man too tired to even despair.

Without hesitation, the Guild Master drove the dagger into the Emperor's heart. As the Emperor drew his final breath, a whisper escaped his lips,

""...Amadia...""


With the Emperor's death there was only one thing left to do.
",281,"战斗已经成为了一个注定的结局，但皇帝依然拒绝屈服。身上满是伤口，他仍然挥舞着剑，孤身一人，所有的盟友都已死去。

然而，最终，皇帝破碎的身体背叛了他，他倒下了，剑从他手中滑落。绝望中，他伸手去抓他的武器，哭喊着，

“这不可能是结局！ 
这一切到底是为了什么？ 
我所做的每一个牺牲！ 我所夺走的每一条生命！ 

这不可能都是徒劳无功！”""

他的呐喊在大厅中回荡，他继续徒劳地试图夺回他的剑……直到，最后，他沉默了。

行会会长看到皇帝仍然活着，走上前去，手中握着一把匕首。当行会会长站在皇帝身上时，皇帝似乎连注意都没有。行会会长注意到他眼中空洞的神情，认出了一个已经放弃所有希望的人的样子。一个连绝望都感到疲惫的人。

毫不犹豫，行会会长将匕首刺入皇帝的心脏。当皇帝吐出最后一口气时，嘴唇间溢出一个低语，

“……阿玛迪亚……”

随着皇帝的死亡，只剩下一件事要做。"

As her fingertips made contact, a brilliant light flooded the chamber, illuminating the path forward.",281,神圣使者向被封印的女神迈出了步伐，手伸向魔法球。当她的指尖接触到魔法球时，璀璨的光芒充盈了整个大厅，照亮了前方的道路。
1834454280474624,WORLDEVENT282_PAGE1,"Falken wore a worried expression, while Astrid seemed livid.

""We have a problem with the novice adventurers, Guild Master,"" Falken expressed.

""The problem is that they're cowards, who'd rather die without a fight!"" Astrid added furiously. After a brief explanation, it became clear that most of the novice adventurers had lost any will to fight upon witnessing the size of the enemy army.

""If we don't do anything about it, they won't be much help in the upcoming battles,"" Falken explained, hoping the Guild Master might have a solution.",282,"法尔肯面露担忧之色，而阿斯特丽德似乎愤怒不已。

“我们在新手冒险者身上遇到了问题，行会会长，”法尔肯表达道。

“问题是他们是懦夫，宁愿不战而死！”阿斯特丽德愤怒地补充道。经过简短的解释，显然大多数新手冒险者在目睹敌军的规模后，已经失去了战斗的意志。

“如果我们不采取任何措施，他们在即将到来的战斗中不会有太大帮助，”法尔肯解释，希望行会会长能有解决办法。"

After a short while, all of them were assembled in front of the Guild Master, and a sense of hopelessness hung in the air. Evidently, these individuals had resigned themselves to a miserable fate, expecting nothing more than an undignified death.

They had no hope, so the only thing the Guild Master could do, was to give them hope. They spoke of imminent help on the way, assuring the novice adventurers that they only needed to hold out until reinforcements arrived.
