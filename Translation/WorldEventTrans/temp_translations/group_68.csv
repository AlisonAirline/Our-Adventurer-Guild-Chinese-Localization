Every so often she would look at the circle, shake her head and start redrawing parts of the circle with new symbols. The Guild Master approached and asked her what she was doing. From close up, they could see the dark circles around Majika's eyes. She looked as if the lack of food was not the only thing affecting her.

""I am attempting to devise a spell that might alleviate the sensation of hunger. Regrettably, my previous attempts, perhaps due to insufficient sleep or proper nutrition, have yielded no success. Nonetheless, there is a glimmer of hope with this latest iteration."" She drew a final mark on the circle and then addressed the adventurers. ""Would any of you be willing to test its effectiveness?""",212,"玛吉卡正在地上画某种魔法阵。她时不时地会看一眼魔法阵，摇摇头，然后用新的符号重新绘制部分魔法阵。公会会长走上前询问她在做什么。近距离观察时，他们可以看到玛吉卡眼睛周围的黑圈。她看起来似乎不仅仅是缺乏食物在影响她。

“我正在尝试设计一个可能缓解饥饿感的法术。不幸的是，我之前的尝试，或许是因为缺乏睡眠或营养不良，未能成功。然而，这个最新的版本让我看到了一丝希望。”她在魔法阵上画下最后一个符号，然后对冒险者们说道：“你们中有人愿意测试它的效果吗？”"

""And? How do you feel?"" Majika inquired. {CHARACTER1} could tell that {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} still felt hungry but was overall less burdened by the feeling. 

""Not exactly the outcome I had envisioned. Nonetheless, it matters little now, as I can discern that I lack the strength for further attempts,"" Majika conceded. ""If you would excuse me, Guild Master,"" she added before suddenly slumping down. Alarmed for a moment, the Guild Master soon realized that Majika had merely fallen asleep. They then asked some of the nearby novice adventurers to carry her to a bed.",212,"{CHARACTER1}踏上了刻有符号的魔法阵，玛吉卡开始吟唱法术。魔法符号闪烁着光芒，将{CHARACTER1}包裹在柔和的光辉中。片刻之后，光芒渐渐消退。

“怎么样？你感觉如何？”玛吉卡询问道。{CHARACTER1}能感觉到{GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她}仍然感到饥饿，但整体上感觉没有那么沉重。

“这并不是我所设想的结果。不过现在这没什么关系，因为我能感受到自己没有力气再进行更多的尝试，”玛吉卡承认道。“如果你能原谅我，公会会长，”她补充道，随后突然瘫倒在地。公会会长一时感到惊慌，但很快意识到玛吉卡只是睡着了。于是他们请附近的一些新手冒险者把她抬到床上。"
