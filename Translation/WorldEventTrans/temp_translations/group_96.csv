Recognizing the need for rest, the Guild Master ordered everyone to return to their quarters and attempt to get some sleep. A somber silence filled the air as the adventurers withdrew.


In the quiet aftermath, the Guild Master hoped that a miracle will occur.",298,"恶魔已被击败，城门再次安全。然而，公会会长能看到这场战斗对冒险者们造成的伤害。与自己的同伴作斗争是一种痛苦的经历，心理上的压力显而易见。  
意识到需要休息，公会会长命令大家返回各自的房间，尽量休息。冒险者们退去时，空气中弥漫着沉重的寂静。  

在这宁静的余波中，公会会长希望奇迹会发生。"
1834454309834755,WORLDEVENT299_PAGE1,"The Guild Master stood on top of the walls, gazing at the enemy's camp. Inside it was a giant ram that would surely tear their gate apart, and there would be little they could do about it. Falken soon joined the Guild Master's side.

""So, this is it, huh? In a few hours, we'll die, unless some divine intervention will save us,"" Falken commented resignated.

""From what I've learned about the gods so far, I wouldn't place my hope on them,"" the Guild Master responded. ""However, I still believe in Lily.""

""Calling the Divine Messenger by her name? How blasphemous,"" Falken said and chuckled.

",299,"公会会长站在城墙上，凝视着敌人的营地。营地中有一台巨大的攻城锤，必定会将他们的城门撕裂，而他们对此几乎无能为力。福尔肯很快加入了公会会长的身边。  

“所以，这就是结局了？再过几个小时，我们就会死，除非有神灵的干预来拯救我们，”福尔肯无奈地评论道。  

“根据我目前对神明的了解，我不会把希望寄托在他们身上，”公会会长回应道。“不过，我依然相信莉莉。”  

“用她的名字称呼神圣使者？真是亵渎，”福尔肯笑着说道。"
1834454309834756,WORLDEVENT299_PAGE2,"A moment of lightness hung in the air, albeit fleeting, before Falken's demeanor shifted, and his next words carried a heartfelt sincerity, ""If this is the end, then I'd like you to know that it has been an honor to have you as our Guild Master. The Guild never would have become what it is now without you. I'm sure Guild Master Fran would have been proud of what you did."" 

The Guild Master smiled in response and replied, ""Thanks, Falken."" As the Guild Master reflected on their time as the leader of the Guild, they realized that what started as a duty out of feelings of guilt toward their deceased friend had grown into a genuine fondness for the Guild and its people.

<i>I'm getting sentimental</i>, they thought sarcastically.",299,"一瞬间的轻松在空气中弥漫，虽然短暂，但随后福尔肯的神情变得严肃，他接下来的话语充满了真诚：“如果这就是结局，我想让你知道，能有你作为我们的公会会长是一种荣幸。没有你，公会绝对不会变成现在这样。我相信会长弗兰会为你所做的一切感到骄傲。”  

公会会长微笑着回应：“谢谢你，福尔肯。”当公会会长回想起自己作为公会领导的时光时，意识到最初出于对已故朋友的愧疚而承担的责任，已经发展成对公会及其成员的真正喜爱。  

<i>我真是感伤</i>，他们讽刺地想着。"

This time, the enemy forwent the walls and instead pushed their newly built ram towards the gate. The Guild's archers did their best to rain arrows on the enemy, causing significant damage, but the ram remained unharmed and barely slowed down. Some mages attempted to cast spells on it, but the enemy's own spellcasters protected it fiercely. Eventually, the ram reached the gate.",299,"突然，敌营中开始有了动静，标志着最后攻击的开始。是时候提醒大家并准备迎接敌人的最后一击了。  

这一次，敌人放弃了城墙，而是将他们新建的攻城锤推向城门。公会的弓箭手们尽力向敌人射箭，造成了相当大的伤害，但攻城锤毫发无损，几乎没有减速。一些法师试图对其施法，但敌人的法师们则拼命保护着它。最终，攻城锤到达了城门。"

A giant rider led the enemy charge into the Guild. The warrior was larger than any man they had ever seen. Was it even a man? It mattered little. The adventurers knew only one thing: the final battle for the Guild had begun.",299,"城门遭受了一次又一次的撞击，每一次重击都让木材承受更大的压力，向内鼓胀。然后，在最后一次强有力的撞击下，城门猛然打开。城门被攻破了。  

一名巨大的骑士率领敌人冲入公会。这个战士比他们见过的任何人都要高大。那甚至还是人吗？这并不重要。冒险者们只知道一件事：公会的最后战斗已经开始。"
1834454314029058,WORLDEVENT300_PAGE1,"The adventurers defeated the enemy's champion but weren't sure if it amounted to anything. More and more enemies started to pour in from the gates, and as the adventurers battled desperately against the overwhelming tide of enemies, fatigue began to wear down their stamina. The Guild Master couldn't help but wonder if this was the end for the Adventurer Guild.

",300,冒险者们击败了敌人的冠军，但不确定这是否有什么意义。越来越多的敌人开始从城门涌入，随着冒险者们在压倒性的敌人潮中拼命战斗，疲惫开始侵蚀他们的耐力。公会会长不禁想，这是否是冒险者公会的终结。
1834454314029059,WORLDEVENT300RESULT0_PAGE1,"Just as all hope seemed to be lost, a single sound cut through the chaos – the resonating blast of a horn.

""Could it be?"" Hope ignited within the Guild Master as they rushed to a safe vantage point. There, on the horizon, an army bearing the banner of House Greyhorn emerged.
",300,"就在所有希望似乎都要破灭之际，一声响亮的号角声穿透了混乱。  

“难道是？”希望在公会会长心中点燃，他们急忙赶往一个安全的高地。在那里，地平线上出现了一支悬挂着格雷霍恩家族旗帜的军队。"

Victory will be ours!"" The news sparked a renewed vigor in the adventurers, who fought with even greater determination. As they pushed back the enemy, the Guild Master observed the army of Greyhorn charging into the flanks of the enemy forces. The sudden, unexpected attack swiftly led to the breaking of the enemy's formation.

With the pincer attack between the newly arrived army and the Adventurer Guild, the followers of the emperor were soon routed, and the battle came to an end. Exhausted adventurers collapsed to the ground, but a final victorious cry echoed through the Guild.

The Adventurer Guild was saved.",300,"“YESSSSSS！”公会会长的欢呼声在堡垒中回荡。“冒险者们！援军来了！保持坚强，反击他们！胜利将属于我们！”这个消息激发了冒险者们的新活力，他们以更大的决心战斗。当他们将敌人逼退时，公会会长观察到格雷霍恩的军队正冲向敌军的侧翼。突如其来的攻击迅速打破了敌人的阵型。  

随着新到军队与冒险者公会的夹击，皇帝的追随者们很快被击溃，战斗也随之结束。疲惫的冒险者们倒在地上，但最后的胜利呐喊在公会中回荡。  

冒险者公会得救了。"
