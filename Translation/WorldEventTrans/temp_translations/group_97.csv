The jotuns appeared to be hunting, as if gathering food for a larger group. The Divine Messenger recognized them as the very group they had been tirelessly pursuing.

However, one of the jotuns suddenly became suspicious, as if sensing an unseen presence. He started to scan the area, and the group quickly scrambled to hide themselves completely.

Despite their efforts, a glimmer of movement caught the jotun's eye, and the whole group was immediately alerted. They swiftly turned around to face the unexpected intruders.

The Guild Master let out a resigned sigh, knowing that there was no avoiding a confrontation now. The adventurers readied themselves to face them.
