The warrior, caught off guard and unable to mount a defense, could only bear the brunt of {CHARACTER1}'s onslaught. With each successive strike, the jotun warrior's resistance crumbled, his body unable to withstand the overwhelming force behind {CHARACTER1}'s attacks.

1834454372749317,WORLDEVENT322_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE3,"Time seemed to stand still for a moment, as the warrior's body teetered on the edge of life and death. Then, with a smile appearing on the warrior's face, the jotun finally succumbed to his wounds. His lifeless form crumpled to the unforgiving ground, the battle axe slipping from his grasp.

The tundra fell silent once more, the only sounds the whispering wind and the fading echoes of the clash. {CHARACTER1} stood amidst the aftermath, {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} chest heaving with exertion. The battle was over.",322,"时间似乎在那一刻静止，战士的身体摇摇欲坠，仿佛在生与死的边缘徘徊。然后，战士脸上露出了微笑，巨人终于屈服于他的伤口。他的无生命躯体无力地倒在无情的地面上，战斧从他的手中滑落。  

冻原再次陷入寂静，唯一的声音是低语的风和渐渐消逝的战斗回声。{CHARACTER1} 站在战斗的余波中，{GENDER1:cond:=1?他的|=0?她的}胸膛因疲惫而起伏不定。战斗结束了。"

Just as victory seemed assured, the jotun warrior's eyes suddenly flickered with newfound determination. In a display of sheer willpower, the warrior summoned his remaining strength and grasped his battle axe tightly. With a primal roar, he swung the weapon in a swift and devastating arc.

Caught off guard by the warrior's unexpected recovery, {CHARACTER1} found {GENDER1:cond:=1?himself|=0?herself} unable to evade the incoming strike.

In an attempt to find solace or any sign of respite, {CHARACTER1} gazed into the distance, squinting through the swirling snowflakes. And there, amidst the hazy backdrop of the blizzard, {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} eyes caught sight of a mysterious figure again. {CHARACTER1} didn't know why but {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} was sure that it was the same figure, {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} spotted before.",324,"寒冷开始对冒险者们造成影响。他们似乎已经走了一个永恒的时间，而无情的暴风雪依旧没有减弱的迹象。
