1834454003650562,WORLDEVENT162_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE1,"{CHARACTER1} stepped forward and accepted the challenge. Seeing his challenger the brawny man gave a condescending smile. His face tells that he already saw himself as the winner of this little contest. 

Both of them started to lock their hands on the ground. On the signal of another Party Member they both started to put their strength into forcing their opponent's hand down.

The smile finally vanished from the brawny man when he realized that he was having a harder time to push his opponents hand down than he expected. In fact, he was starting to lose ground. {CHARACTER1} was much stronger than he expected. ",162,"{CHARACTER1} 向前迈步，接受了挑战。看到他的对手，那个壮汉露出了居高临下的微笑。他的脸上写满了自信，似乎已经将自己视为这场小比赛的胜者。

他们俩开始将手锁定在地面上。在另一名队员的信号下，他们都开始用力将对方的手压下去。

当壮汉意识到自己比预想中更难将对手的手压下时，脸上的微笑终于消失了。实际上，他开始失去优势。{CHARACTER1} 的力量远超他的预期。"
1834454003650563,WORLDEVENT162_DECISION1RESULT0_PAGE2,"The brawny man tried to channel all his strength to regain ground but in the end his hand was forced to the ground by {CHARACTER1}.

 {CHARACTER1} raised {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} fist triumphantly into the air and the others cheered for {GENDER1:cond:=1?him|=0?her}. The brawny man mumbled something along the line ""it was just an armwrestling match"" and ""nothing to get excited about"". 

He stood up and gave a halfhearted farewell before leaving the Adventurers in a hurry, clearly trying to escape his shame.
Seeing that the Adventurers couldn't help but smile.",162,"壮汉试图集中所有力量来夺回优势，但最终他的手被 {CHARACTER1} 压到了地上。

{CHARACTER1} 得意洋洋地将 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他的|=0?她的} 拳头高高举起，其他人也为 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 欢呼。壮汉嘟囔着“这不过是场臂力比赛”和“没什么好兴奋的”。

他站起身，心不在焉地告别，然后匆匆离开冒险者，显然是在试图逃避自己的羞辱。看到这一幕，冒险者们忍不住微笑。"

Both of them started to lock their hands on the ground. On the signal of another Party Member they both started to put their strength into forcing their opponent's hand down.

Both of their hands were in a complete standstill. {CHARACTER1} tried to muster as much strength as {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} could but {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} couldn't make {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} opponent's hand budge. At least {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} opponent was in the same situation seeing as how the man didn't smile any more...or so {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} thought. 

Suddenly the brawny man started to smile again and started to push {CHARACTER1}'s hand down. {CHARACTER1} realized that the man was just toying with {GENDER1:cond:=1?him|=0?her}. {GENDER1:cond:=1?he|=0?she} tried {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} best to resist but in the end {GENDER1:cond:=1?his|=0?her} hand was forced down to the ground.",162,"{CHARACTER1} 向前迈步，接受了挑战。看到他的对手，那个壮汉露出了居高临下的微笑。他的脸上写满了自信，似乎已经将自己视为这场小比赛的胜者。

两人的手完全僵持不下。{CHARACTER1} 尽力使出所有力量，但 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 无法让 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他的|=0?她的} 对手的手动一下。至少 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他的|=0?她的} 对手也处于同样的境地，因为那个男人不再微笑……或者说 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 是这么认为的。

突然，壮汉又开始微笑，并开始将 {CHARACTER1} 的手压下。{CHARACTER1} 意识到这个男人只是在戏弄 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她}。{GENDER1:cond:=1?他|=0?她} 尽力抵抗，但最终 {GENDER1:cond:=1?他的|=0?她的} 手被压到了地面上。"

 ""You weren't too shabby but of course nowhere near my level. Maybe next time if you train a little bit more. But I wouldn't count on it."" He laughed again. He bid the Adventurers farewell and left whistling a happy tune.

{CHARACTER1} felt extremely humilitated.",162,"那个男人开始大笑：“看来是我赢了，没什么意外。” 他拍了拍 {CHARACTER1} 的肩膀。

“你还不错，但当然远不及我的水平。也许下次如果你多训练一下。但我可不指望你。” 他又笑了笑，向冒险者们告别，边走边哼着快乐的曲调。

{CHARACTER1} 感到非常羞辱。"

""Of course, of course. I'd also have no confidence after seeing someone like me. So I let you save face here."" 

The man smiled condescendingly and left the adventurers while whistling a happy tune. They felt slightly annoyed but it was better than dealing with that kind of a troublesome person.",162,"队伍拒绝了，表示他们没有时间参与这种游戏。“当然，当然。看到像我这样的人，你们也没有信心。所以我让你们在这里保全面子。”

那个男人居高临下地微笑着，边哼着快乐的曲调离开了冒险者们。他们感到稍微有些恼火，但总比面对那种麻烦的人要好。"
1834454007844866,WORLDEVENT163_PAGE1,"As the adventurers continued their journey, an arrow suddenly flew right past them, embedding itself into the ground nearby. They scanned the area for the shooter but couldn't find anyone nearby.

Upon closer inspection, the adventurers noticed that there was a message attached to the arrow. They retrieved it and read:

仔细一看，冒险者们注意到箭上附着了一条信息。他们取下信息并阅读："

这时他们还注意到箭矢扎在了看似是狼的足迹附近。合理推测，这些足迹很可能属于信息中提到的那群野兽。"
